### Patch Changes

- [#667](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/667) [`8048ee4`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/8048ee411d770255c3e6fcf6a5d9f0369dc16b2f) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Drop runtime dependency on the private `@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded` workspace package. Previously published `@ifc-lite/geometry` manifests pointed at `@ifc-lite/wasm-threaded@0.1.0`, which is intentionally non-publishable, causing `npm install @ifc-lite/geometry` to fail. The threaded bundle is only imported by the single-controller worker behind a feature flag and is always supplied via a host bundler alias, so it now lives in `devDependencies` with an optional `peerDependency` documenting the alias contract.

### Patch Changes

- [#656](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/656) [`384efaa`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/384efaaaee45cd6f36d3a107899b3b4106143c9a) Thanks [@maxkrut](https://github.com/maxkrut)! - Reject overlapping WASM streaming geometry runs with a controlled JavaScript error before re-entering the processor.

- [#633](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/633) [`7b70805`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7b70805632627a6e4351b1735479be18390c8b21) Thanks [@maxkrut](https://github.com/maxkrut)! - Fix published worker URLs to reference the emitted JavaScript file.

  `@ifc-lite/geometry` starts parallel geometry processing by constructing
  module workers from `geometry-parallel`. The published npm package includes
  `dist/geometry.worker.js`, but `dist/geometry-parallel.js` still points at
  `./geometry.worker.ts`, so consumers can fail to load the worker at runtime.

  Keep source worker URLs pointing at TypeScript files for in-repo Vite builds,
  and extend the post-build rewrite so published `dist/index.js` and
  `dist/geometry-parallel.js` point at the emitted JavaScript worker files.

## 1.18.1

### Patch Changes

- [#644](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/644) [`6f052c3`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/6f052c309a99edd1d9a6925d44bbc2aed6cd10a5) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add "Merge Multilayer Walls" load-time toggle (issue #540).

  When enabled, every `IfcBuildingElementPart` whose `IfcRelAggregates`
  parent wall (a) has its own `Representation` and (b) is sliceable in
  `MaterialLayerIndex` is suppressed during geometry emission. The parent
  wall's single swept solid keeps the per-layer sub-mesh colouring via the
  existing slicer, so the visual result on multilayer walls is the same as
  the layered render — but with one mesh per wall instead of N per-layer
  parts. Designed for large Revit-exported models where the per-layer
  extrusions inflate vertex counts beyond what the viewer can handle.

  New JS surface on `IfcAPI`:

  ```ts
  setMergeLayers(enabled: boolean): void
  ```

  Defaults to `false`. Honoured by `parseMeshes`, `parseMeshesSubset`,
  `parseMeshesAsync`, `parseMeshesInstanced`, `parseMeshesInstancedAsync`,
  `processGeometryBatch`, and `processGeometryBatchParallel`. The batch
  paths cache the parts-to-skip set on `IfcAPI` so workers build it once
  per content and reuse across every batch; the cache is cleared by
  `clearPrePassCache` and by `setMergeLayers`.

  Voids stay correct: `propagate_voids_to_parts` already copies the
  parent wall's `IfcRelVoidsElement` references onto its layer parts in
  the same pass that builds the part → parent map, so windows and doors
  still cut through the merged solid.

### Minor Changes

- [#629](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/629) [`2ab0e4c`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2ab0e4c0eafc21feb22bfc7cd96c467b8b9ff599) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - **Parse IFC off the main thread.** The browser viewer now runs `IfcParser.parseColumnar`
  inside a dedicated `WorkerParser` worker that shares the source bytes via
  `SharedArrayBuffer` with the existing geometry workers. Parse and geometry
  streaming run in parallel without contending for main-thread time, cutting
  upload-to-interactive wall-clock by roughly 2× on medium-to-large files.

  New public APIs:

  - `@ifc-lite/parser`

    - `WorkerParser` (browser-only, exported from `@ifc-lite/parser/browser`)
    - `data-store-transport`: `toTransport(store)` / `fromTransport(payload, source)`
      plus the `DataStoreTransport` payload type. Lets any consumer ship a
      fully-typed `IfcDataStore` across a `postMessage` boundary with the
      typed-array buffers in the transfer list and closures rebuilt on receipt.

  - `@ifc-lite/data`

    - `entityTableFromColumns` / `entityTableToColumns`
    - `propertyTableFromColumns` / `propertyTableToColumns`
    - `quantityTableFromColumns` / `quantityTableToColumns`
    - `relationshipGraphFromColumns` / `relationshipGraphToColumns`
    - `relationshipEdgesFromColumns`, `relationshipGraphFromEdges`, `buildCSR`
    - `StringTable.fromArray(strings)`
    - `EntityTable.rawTypeName` is now exposed (optional column) so the
      unknown-type display fallback round-trips through column transports.

  - `@ifc-lite/geometry`

    - `processParallel(buffer, coordinator, sharedRtcOffset?, existingSab?, options?)`:
      `existingSab` lets the geometry workers reuse a SAB the caller already
      populated. The new fifth argument is `ProcessParallelOptions` with:
      - `onEntityIndex(ids, starts, lengths)`: invoked once the streaming
        pre-pass has built the entity index. Hosts forward the SAB-shared
        columns to `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex(...)` so the parser skips
        its own ~10 s WASM scan.
      - `useSingleController`: opt-in (off by default) to the experimental
        single-controller + wasm-bindgen-rayon path. See
        `docs/architecture/single-controller-rayon-design.md` §12 for the
        post-mortem on when this helps and when it regresses.
    - `GeometryProcessor.processParallel` and `processAdaptive` accept the
      same options to plumb them through.
    - `StreamingGeometryEvent` gains a `workerMemory` variant carrying
      per-worker WASM heap + mesh-byte counts for memory accounting.

  - `@ifc-lite/parser` (additions on top of the worker entry above)
    - `WorkerParser.setEntityIndex(ids, starts, lengths)`: hand a pre-built
      entity index to the worker's `IfcAPI`. Pairs with the geometry
      pre-pass's `onEntityIndex` callback above.
    - `WorkerParserOptions.waitForEntityIndex`: when true, the worker blocks
      its WASM scan until `setEntityIndex` arrives (60 s watchdog falls
      back to the regular scan if it never does).
    - `IfcParser.parseColumnar`: signature widened to accept
      `ArrayBuffer | SharedArrayBuffer` (was `ArrayBuffer`); the SAB-backed
      parser worker no longer needs an `as unknown as ArrayBuffer` cast.

  The viewer auto-falls back to the in-process `IfcParser` when
  `crossOriginIsolated` is `false` or the worker spawn throws, so behavior is
  unchanged in environments without SAB.

### Patch Changes

- [#637](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/637) [`2334993`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/2334993827839b9f5b96ca8008c49543fb597660) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `Could not resolve entry module "geometry.worker.ts"` when bundling the
  published `@ifc-lite/geometry` package with Vite/Rollup.

  `src/geometry-parallel.ts` constructs module workers via
  `new Worker(new URL('./geometry.worker.ts', import.meta.url), ...)`. The post-
  build step in `package.json` rewrites those `.ts` URLs to `.js` so the npm
  tarball ships URLs that point at the emitted file — but the rewrite was only
  applied to `dist/index.js`, and the worker URLs live in `dist/geometry-parallel.js`.
  Consumers like the `create-ifc-lite` Vite templates therefore tried to load a
  `.ts` worker entry that is not present in the tarball and the build failed.

  Apply the rewrite to every `.js` file in `dist/`, leaving the source TypeScript
  URL unchanged so in-repo Vite builds keep resolving the worker from source.

- [#641](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/641) [`ba7553a`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/ba7553af693939896a840074999b5f6806a94815) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `IfcReinforcingBar` stirrup rendering (issue #631, sample
  `IfcReinforcingBar.ifc`).

  `IfcSweptDiskSolid` directrixes that use `IfcIndexedPolyCurve` over
  `IfcCartesianPointList3D` (typical for stirrups and other bent rebar that
  lives outside the XY plane) used to fall back to a 2D parser that read x/y
  from indices 0–1 and silently dropped the Z coordinate. The stirrup
  collapsed onto z=0 and the resulting tube was a flat near-degenerate line.

  The 3D curve dispatcher now has a native arm for `IfcIndexedPolyCurve` that
  reads `IfcCartesianPointList2D` (z=0) or `IfcCartesianPointList3D` verbatim
  and fits `IfcArcIndex` segments using a circumcircle in the plane of their
  three control points. Straight schema conformance — no spec deviation.

  The second sample on the issue (`Rebar2.ifc`) was already rendering its
  directrix correctly under the existing segment-index trim path; no change
  needed there.

### Patch Changes

- [#630](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/630) [`5439cce`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/5439cce34edaff1c050ce8975a330163167df6fd) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Render `IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered` (issue #628).

  Tapered extrusions (e.g. beams or columns whose cross-section transitions
  between a `SweptArea` profile at the base and an `EndSweptArea` profile at
  `Depth`) were recognised by the parser but silently skipped by the geometry
  engine, so the elements never appeared in the viewer.

  The Rust geometry crate now ships:

  - `extrude_profile_lofted` in `extrusion.rs` — generates caps from each
    profile's own triangulation and stitches the side walls 1:1, resampling
    the shorter outer loop by arc length when authoring tools emit profiles
    with mismatched vertex counts. Side normals are computed from the actual
    3D quad so sloped faces shade correctly.
  - `ExtrudedAreaSolidTaperedProcessor` registered alongside the existing
    `ExtrudedAreaSolidProcessor`. Falls back to a uniform extrusion if
    `EndSweptArea` is missing so malformed files still render.
  - `IfcExtrudedAreaSolidTapered` is now accepted by `profile_extractor`
    (used by 2D drawing projection) and the `IfcMappedItem` dispatcher.

  Out of scope for this patch and called out for follow-up:
  `IfcRevolvedAreaSolidTapered`, plus tapered solids participating in
  `IfcBooleanClippingResult` / openings / material-layer slicing.

  pointcloud samples (`pcd::base64`, `points::array`, `points::base64`).

  - New `@ifc-lite/pointcloud` package: renderer-agnostic decoders for PCD
    (ASCII / binary / binary_compressed via inline LZF) and the two inline
    IFCx point schemas. Pure TS, no three.js, no WebGPU.
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry` adds `PointCloudAsset` and `GeometryResult.pointClouds`.
  - `@ifc-lite/ifcx` adds `extractPointClouds()` and surfaces decoded scans
    on `IfcxParseResult.pointClouds`. The mesh extractor is unchanged.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser` re-exports the new `PointCloudExtraction` type.
  - `@ifc-lite/renderer` gains a WGSL `topology: 'point-list'` pipeline,
    per-asset GPU buffers, and `Renderer.setPointClouds()` /
    `Renderer.addPointClouds()`. Points share the depth buffer and section
    plane state with the triangle pipeline.

### Patch Changes

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Address CodeRabbit + Codex review feedback on PR #608.

  Critical visual / correctness fixes:

  - Point splats rendered ~2× too large because the shader treated the
    user-facing `pointSizePx` (diameter) as the splat radius. Fixed in
    both the live splat shader and the picker shader so click targets
    match the rendered disc.
  - Routed every detected point-cloud format (`ply`, `pcd`, `e57`) through
    the streaming ingest in both `useIfcLoader` (single-file drop) and
    `useIfcFederation` (multi-file). Previously only `las/laz` got the
    pointcloud branch; `ply/pcd/e57` fell through into the IFC STEP path.
  - Federation: applied `idOffset` to `geometryResult.pointClouds` too so
    multi-pointcloud-model loads don't collide on local `expressId`.
  - `expressId` defaulted to `1` on every ingest, so multiple inline LAS
    loads collided. Now uses a process-local synthetic counter.
  - E57 integer color channels are commonly u16 (0..65535); reader was
    forcing u8 reads, distorting RGB. Now picks element width from the
    declared min/max range.
  - PCD `applyStride` preserved positions + colors but dropped intensity
    and classification, so those color modes silently broke on files
    past the 25M-point downsample cap.
  - Inline `uploadAssetToGpu` forwards `intensities` + `classifications`
    (added to `PointCloudAsset.chunk` shape).
  - Model bounds recomputed after `removePointCloudAsset` /
    `clearPointClouds` — previously stayed oversized, breaking
    fit-to-view and section sliders.
  - `usePointCloudLifecycle` disposes a model's GPU asset when the model
    stays in the store but its `pointCloudHandleId` changes (re-stream of
    the same file used to leak the old handle).
  - `resetViewerState` now clears the point-cloud slice runtime fields so
    loading a new file doesn't inherit the previous file's color mode /
    size / EDL state.

  Correctness / robustness:

  - `streamPointCloud`'s host now closes the source on probe + onOpen
    failures (single try/finally wrapping the whole open-and-decode
    flow), so worker-backed sources don't leak the decoder on parse
    errors or aborts.
  - `worker-client.close()` clears cached `info`; subsequent `open()`
    actually re-opens instead of returning stale info next to a null
    `sourceId`.
  - `LasStreamingSource.open()` and `LazStreamingSource.open()` are
    atomic on failure: state is committed only after every step
    succeeds, so a retry rerruns the probe + RGB-scale detection
    cleanly. LAZ also frees malloc'd wasm pointers in the catch path.
  - PLY decoder rejects files where `vertex` isn't the first element
    (decoder reads from `header.bodyOffset`; non-leading vertex would
    silently produce garbage).
  - `decodePointsArray` validates each `colors[i]` is a `[r,g,b]` triple
    before indexing, so malformed schemas fail with a clear message.
  - `useIfcLoader` LAS/LAZ/PLY/PCD/E57 branch is guarded by
    `loadSessionRef` on both error and success paths so a newer load can
    replace an in-flight one without overwriting the newer model state;
    stale renderer handle is freed.

  Critical webhook fixes:

  - `ViewportOverlays.tsx` had three imports between executable code;
    hoisted them above the `const isDesktop = isTauri()` declaration.
  - `edl-pass.ts` used `0u` for `texture_depth_multisampled_2d`'s
    `sample_index`; WGSL spec requires `i32`.
  - `pcd.test.ts` switched from `__dirname` to
    `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` so it works outside vitest's
    CommonJS-compat shim.

  UX polish:

  - `PointCloudPanel` toggle buttons expose `aria-pressed` so screen
    readers announce the active option.
  - `pointCloudSlice` setters reject `NaN`/`Infinity` (Math.min/max
    passes them through unchanged).
  - `BlobByteSource.read` clamps a negative `start` to `0`.
  - File-dialog filters split GLB out of the IFC bucket into a "Mesh
    Files" group.

  The flattenMatrix transpose flagged in the review is actually correct
  for USD's row-major-with-translation-in-row-3 convention (verified by
  inspecting the Point_Cloud_S1 sample's transform; the rendered scan is
  at the right world position). Added a clarifying comment so future
  reviewers don't reach for the wrong fix.

### Patch Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

  - Fix transform_mesh to apply RTC uniformly per-mesh (not per-vertex) preventing mixed coordinates
  - Fix coordinate-handler.ts threshold consistency between bounds calculation and vertex cleanup
  - Fix streaming path originalBounds reconstruction by undoing server-applied shift
  - Surface RTC offset in GpuGeometry struct with JS-accessible getters (rtcOffsetX/Y/Z, hasRtcOffset)

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- f4fbf8c: ### New Features

  - **2D Profile-Level Boolean Operations**: Implemented efficient 2D polygon boolean operations for void subtraction at the profile level before extrusion. This provides 10-25x performance improvement over 3D CSG operations for most openings and produces cleaner geometry with fewer degenerate triangles.

  - **Void Analysis and Classification**: Added intelligent void classification system that distinguishes between coplanar voids (can be handled efficiently in 2D) and non-planar voids (require 3D CSG). This enables optimal processing strategy selection.

  - **Enhanced Void Handling**: Improved void subtraction in extrusions with support for both full-depth and partial-depth voids, including segmented extrusion for complex void configurations.

  ### Improvements

  - **WASM Compatibility**: Replaced `clipper2` (C++ dependency) with `i_overlay` (pure Rust) for WASM builds, eliminating C++ compilation issues and ensuring reliable WASM builds.

  - **Performance**: Profile-level void subtraction is significantly faster than 3D CSG operations, especially for floors/slabs with many penetrations.

- f4fbf8c: ### New Features

  - **Type visibility controls**: Toggle visibility of spatial elements (IfcSpace, IfcOpeningElement, IfcSite) in the viewer toolbar
  - **Enhanced CSG operations**: Improved boolean geometry operations using the `csgrs` library for better performance and accuracy

  - **Fixed IFCPROJECT detection**: Now scans entire file to find IFCPROJECT instead of only first 100 entities, fixing issues with large IFC files

- ed8f77b: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Lite Parsing Mode**: Added optimized parsing mode for large files (>100MB) with 5-10x faster parsing performance
  - **On-Demand Property Extraction**: Implemented on-demand property extraction for instant property access, eliminating upfront table building overhead

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed Relationship Graph**: Added DefinesByProperties to relationship graph in lite mode
  - **Fixed On-Demand Maps**: Improved forward relationship lookup for rebuilding on-demand maps
  - **Fixed Property Extraction**: Restored on-demand property extraction when loading from cache

- f7133a3: ### Performance Improvements

  - **Zero-copy WASM memory to WebGPU upload**: Implemented direct memory access from WASM linear memory to WebGPU buffers, eliminating intermediate JavaScript copies. This provides 60-70% reduction in peak RAM usage and 40-50% faster geometry-to-GPU pipeline.

  - **Optimized cache and spatial hierarchy**: Eliminated O(n²) lookups in cache and spatial hierarchy builder, implemented instant cache lookup with larger batches, and optimized batch streaming for better performance.

  - **Parallelized data model parsing**: Added parallel processing for data model parsing and streaming of cached geometry with deferred hash computation and yielding before heavy decode operations.

  ### New Features

  - **Zero-copy benchmark suite**: Added comprehensive benchmark suite to measure zero-copy performance improvements and identify bottlenecks.

  - **GPU geometry API**: Added new GPU-ready geometry API with pre-interleaved vertex data, pre-converted coordinates, and pointer-based direct WASM memory access.

  ### Bug Fixes

  - **Fixed O(n²) batch recreation**: Eliminated inefficient batch recreation in zero-copy streaming pipeline.

  - **Updated WASM and TypeScript definitions**: Updated WASM bindings and TypeScript definitions for geometry classes to support zero-copy operations.
