# @ifc-lite/renderer

## 1.18.0

### Minor Changes

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - GPU-based point picking, federation-aware.

  Clicks on point cloud splats now resolve through the existing `Picker`
  flow and return `PickResult{expressId, modelIndex}` exactly like mesh
  picks. Selection / hover / measurement all participate without further
  plumbing.

  How it works:

  - New `PointPicker` runs a second pipeline in the same `r32uint`
    picking pass as the mesh picker. Splats inflate by an extra 2 px of
    click tolerance, then write `0x80000000 | (expressId & 0x7FFFFFFF)`.
  - `Picker.pick()` accepts an optional `pointNodes` + `pointSizing`
    argument. Both pipelines share the same depth buffer, so points
    occlude meshes and vice versa during the pick.
  - Bit 31 of the readback distinguishes mesh vs point hits.
  - `PickingManager` exposes `setPointPickProvider()` so the renderer can
    hand it a fresh node snapshot + sizing per pick — keeps the manager
    decoupled from `PointCloudRenderer`.

  Round mask matches the live splat shader: picking the corner area of a
  splat that's outside the rendered disc returns null, so the click
  target visually matches what the user sees.

  A follow-on will add depth-texel readback to recover the picked world
  position (XYZ + classification + intensity) for hover tooltips —
  deferred so this lands clean.

  pointcloud samples (`pcd::base64`, `points::array`, `points::base64`).

  - New `@ifc-lite/pointcloud` package: renderer-agnostic decoders for PCD
    (ASCII / binary / binary_compressed via inline LZF) and the two inline
    IFCx point schemas. Pure TS, no three.js, no WebGPU.
  - `@ifc-lite/geometry` adds `PointCloudAsset` and `GeometryResult.pointClouds`.
  - `@ifc-lite/ifcx` adds `extractPointClouds()` and surfaces decoded scans
    on `IfcxParseResult.pointClouds`. The mesh extractor is unchanged.
  - `@ifc-lite/parser` re-exports the new `PointCloudExtraction` type.
  - `@ifc-lite/renderer` gains a WGSL `topology: 'point-list'` pipeline,
    per-asset GPU buffers, and `Renderer.setPointClouds()` /
    `Renderer.addPointClouds()`. Points share the depth buffer and section
    plane state with the triangle pipeline.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Phases 1–4 of point cloud loading.

  - **LAS streaming** (`.las` files) — header parser + per-point record decoder
    for ASPRS Point Data Formats 0–10, with auto-detection of "8-bit RGB
    in u16 channels" producers and on-the-fly rescaling.
  - **LAZ streaming** (`.laz` files) — wraps `laz-perf` (Apache-2.0) as a
    runtime dep, decoded inside a Web Worker so the main thread stays
    responsive.
  - **Streaming pipeline** — Blob-backed byte source, decode worker with a
    postMessage protocol that ships chunks back as transferable typed-array
    buffers, host-side controller that paces decode, applies a 25M-point
    memory cap with stride downsampling, and reports progress / completion.
  - **Renderer streaming API** — `Renderer.beginPointCloudStream`,
    `appendPointCloudChunk`, `endPointCloudStream`, `removePointCloudAsset`,
    `setPointCloudOptions`. Streamed assets coexist with IFCx-derived
    assets in separate ownership buckets so `setPointClouds` doesn't clobber
    active streams.
  - **Color modes** — `rgb` / `classification` (ASPRS palette) / `intensity` /
    `height` (cool-warm ramp) / `fixed`. Per-point classification + intensity
    travel through the GPU vertex layout and the WGSL shader picks the
    channel based on the active mode uniform.
  - **Viewer integration** — file picker accepts `.las,.laz` (browser drop +
    native dialog), a small bottom-left panel exposes the color modes when
    point clouds are loaded, and the federation registry's `modelIndex`
    flows through streaming ingest for multi-model picking parity.

  GPU-based point picking is deferred to a follow-up; clicks on points
  return null and don't crash existing mesh selection.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Point cloud rendering quality: splat pipeline + Eye-Dome Lighting.

  The 1-pixel `point-list` rendering looked great from far away but turned
  into a halftone screen as you zoomed in — `point-list` topology has no
  `gl_PointSize` equivalent in WebGPU, so density was fixed in screen space.

  This swaps the pipeline for instanced 6-vertex quad splats and adds a
  post-pass EDL for depth perception.

  **Splat pipeline**

  - `topology: 'triangle-list'`, vertex buffer `stepMode: 'instance'`,
    6 verts emitted per source point. Vertex shader picks a corner from
    `vertex_index` and inflates clip-space position by the active size.
  - Three size modes:
    - `fixed-px` — every splat is N pixels (1..20)
    - `adaptive-world` — splat covers a world-space radius, projected each
      frame; closer = bigger
    - `attenuated` (default) — adaptive but clamped to [1, N] px so splats
      stay visible at far plane and don't blow up to half the screen up close
  - Round shape: fragment discards corners outside the unit disc, so splats
    render as discs not squares.

  **Eye-Dome Lighting**

  - New `EdlPass` runs after the existing PostProcessor. Samples 4 (low) or
    8 (high) neighbouring depths at radius R px, computes mean log-depth-
    diff, darkens by `1 - exp(-300 * meanLog * strength)`. ~9 texture taps
    per pixel. Only active when point clouds are loaded.
  - Reverse-Z aware (`max(0, log(centre) - log(neighbour))`), early-out at
    the far plane.

  **UI**

  - `PointCloudPanel` gains size-mode buttons, a 1–20 px slider, a 1–100 mm
    world-radius slider (visible in adaptive/attenuated modes), and an EDL
    toggle with a 0–3 strength slider.
  - New `pointCloudSlice` fields: `pointCloudSizeMode`, `pointCloudPointSize`,
    `pointCloudWorldRadius`, `pointCloudRoundShape`, `pointCloudEdlEnabled`,
    `pointCloudEdlStrength`. Slice clamps numeric ranges.

  Renderer API additions: `setEdlOptions({enabled, strength, radiusPx,
highQuality})`. `setPointCloudOptions` now also accepts `sizeMode`,
  `worldRadius`, `roundShape`.

### Patch Changes

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Round 3 of point cloud fixes — correctness gaps that block multi-model
  sessions and silent rendering stalls.

  **Federation relabel for streamed point clouds.**
  `ingestPointCloud` now emits a synthetic entry on
  `geometryResult.pointClouds`. Without this, `useIfcFederation`'s
  `idOffset` fold + `relabelPointCloudAsset` call never fired for
  LAS/LAZ/PLY/PCD/E57 streams, so picked `expressId`s for streamed
  assets collided across federated models.

  **Sync-throw cleanup.** Wrap `streamPointCloud()` in `try/catch`
  inside `ingestPointCloud`. The renderer asset and asset-count
  increment happen before the worker spins up, so a sync throw during
  validation/worker setup used to leak both. We now `removePointCloudAsset`

  - `onCountChange(-1)` before re-throwing.

  **`setPointClouds()` shrinks bounds correctly.** The replace path
  called `expandModelBoundsForPointClouds` (grow-only). Reloading IFCx
  with a smaller scan kept stale extents until `clear`. Switched to
  `recomputeModelBounds()` so bounds re-baseline from current state.

  **`requestRender()` after every mutation.** `appendPointCloudChunk`,
  `setPointCloudOptions`, `setEdlOptions`, `setPointClouds`,
  `addPointClouds`, `clearPointClouds`, `removePointCloudAsset`,
  `endPointCloudStream` now schedule a frame. Previously streamed
  chunks could sit invisible until an unrelated camera move triggered
  the next render.

  **Worker cancel race.** `worker-client.next()` now re-checks
  `signal.aborted` after `await session.send()`. A chunk that won the
  race against `cancel()` would otherwise still call `onChunk` after
  the host returned to the caller.

  **Multi-scan E57 rejection.** `parseE57Xml` now records `hasPose` per
  Data3D entry. `decodeE57` rejects multi-scan files where any entry
  carries a `<pose>` element, with a clear "registered multi-scan;
  re-export as merged" error. Previously such files silently
  concatenated in scan-local space and rendered misaligned.

  Verified: 62 pointcloud unit tests (1 new for pose flag), full repo
  typecheck (24/24), viewer Vite build green.

  Critical visual / correctness fixes:

  - Point splats rendered ~2× too large because the shader treated the
    user-facing `pointSizePx` (diameter) as the splat radius. Fixed in
    both the live splat shader and the picker shader so click targets
    match the rendered disc.
  - Routed every detected point-cloud format (`ply`, `pcd`, `e57`) through
    the streaming ingest in both `useIfcLoader` (single-file drop) and
    `useIfcFederation` (multi-file). Previously only `las/laz` got the
    pointcloud branch; `ply/pcd/e57` fell through into the IFC STEP path.
  - Federation: applied `idOffset` to `geometryResult.pointClouds` too so
    multi-pointcloud-model loads don't collide on local `expressId`.
  - `expressId` defaulted to `1` on every ingest, so multiple inline LAS
    loads collided. Now uses a process-local synthetic counter.
  - E57 integer color channels are commonly u16 (0..65535); reader was
    forcing u8 reads, distorting RGB. Now picks element width from the
    declared min/max range.
  - PCD `applyStride` preserved positions + colors but dropped intensity
    and classification, so those color modes silently broke on files
    past the 25M-point downsample cap.
  - Inline `uploadAssetToGpu` forwards `intensities` + `classifications`
    (added to `PointCloudAsset.chunk` shape).
  - Model bounds recomputed after `removePointCloudAsset` /
    `clearPointClouds` — previously stayed oversized, breaking
    fit-to-view and section sliders.
  - `usePointCloudLifecycle` disposes a model's GPU asset when the model
    stays in the store but its `pointCloudHandleId` changes (re-stream of
    the same file used to leak the old handle).
  - `resetViewerState` now clears the point-cloud slice runtime fields so
    loading a new file doesn't inherit the previous file's color mode /
    size / EDL state.

  Correctness / robustness:

  - `streamPointCloud`'s host now closes the source on probe + onOpen
    failures (single try/finally wrapping the whole open-and-decode
    flow), so worker-backed sources don't leak the decoder on parse
    errors or aborts.
  - `worker-client.close()` clears cached `info`; subsequent `open()`
    actually re-opens instead of returning stale info next to a null
    `sourceId`.
  - `LasStreamingSource.open()` and `LazStreamingSource.open()` are
    atomic on failure: state is committed only after every step
    succeeds, so a retry rerruns the probe + RGB-scale detection
    cleanly. LAZ also frees malloc'd wasm pointers in the catch path.
  - PLY decoder rejects files where `vertex` isn't the first element
    (decoder reads from `header.bodyOffset`; non-leading vertex would
    silently produce garbage).
  - `decodePointsArray` validates each `colors[i]` is a `[r,g,b]` triple
    before indexing, so malformed schemas fail with a clear message.
  - `useIfcLoader` LAS/LAZ/PLY/PCD/E57 branch is guarded by
    `loadSessionRef` on both error and success paths so a newer load can
    replace an in-flight one without overwriting the newer model state;
    stale renderer handle is freed.

  Critical webhook fixes:

  - `ViewportOverlays.tsx` had three imports between executable code;
    hoisted them above the `const isDesktop = isTauri()` declaration.
  - `edl-pass.ts` used `0u` for `texture_depth_multisampled_2d`'s
    `sample_index`; WGSL spec requires `i32`.
  - `pcd.test.ts` switched from `__dirname` to
    `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` so it works outside vitest's
    CommonJS-compat shim.

  UX polish:

  - `PointCloudPanel` toggle buttons expose `aria-pressed` so screen
    readers announce the active option.
  - `pointCloudSlice` setters reject `NaN`/`Infinity` (Math.min/max
    passes them through unchanged).
  - `BlobByteSource.read` clamps a negative `start` to `0`.
  - File-dialog filters split GLB out of the IFC bucket into a "Mesh
    Files" group.

  The flattenMatrix transpose flagged in the review is actually correct
  for USD's row-major-with-translation-in-row-3 convention (verified by
  inspecting the Point_Cloud_S1 sample's transform; the rendered scan is
  at the right world position). Added a clarifying comment so future
  reviewers don't reach for the wrong fix.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Round 2 of CodeRabbit review fixes — correctness + robustness.

  P1 (real correctness):

  - Federation: streamed point clouds now get the post-`idOffset` global
    expressId in picking output. New `Renderer.relabelPointCloudAsset()`
    updates a per-asset uniform (`flags.x`) the shader prefers over the
    per-vertex attribute, so federation is just a metadata write — no
    GPU buffer rewrite. `useIfcFederation.addModel` calls it after the
    pointClouds offset is applied.
  - Section-plane range now folds in `pointCloudRenderer.getBounds()`, so
    pure point-cloud scenes don't fall through to `[-100, 100]` and mixed
    scenes don't clip points outside a smaller mesh-only range.
  - `recomputeModelBounds()` now recomputes from scratch (mesh baseline +
    current pc bounds) instead of growing-only. Previously, removing one
    of several point clouds left stale oversized extents until every
    point cloud was gone.
  - `streamPointCloud` validates `chunkSize > 0` upfront; `LasStreamingSource`
    and `LazStreamingSource` reject `maxPoints <= 0`. Prevents
    zero-progress decode loops from accidental misuse.
  - E57 merge uses `some()` instead of `every()`; mixed-attribute files
    no longer drop colour/intensity for the whole merged cloud just
    because one scan lacks the channel.
  - E57 intensity is now allocated for `Integer`-encoded prototypes too
    (was silently dropped); `ScaledInteger` throws a clear error.

  P2 (robustness):

  - `xml-mini` rejects truncated input — unclosed elements throw instead
    of silently returning a partial tree.
  - `worker-client.next()` now sends a `kind: 'abort'` to the worker when
    the signal fires mid-flight. Previously cancel returned to the caller
    while the worker kept decoding.
  - `decodePointsArray` rejects empty arrays (was producing ±Infinity
    bbox); `decodePointsBase64` rejects empty strings (no silent
    downgrade to uncoloured cloud).
  - `transformPositionsZUpToYUp` guards against zero / non-finite
    homogeneous `w` (malformed `usd::xformop` matrices).

  P3 (polish):

  - `POINT_CLOUD_DEFAULTS` is now an exported constant shared by the
    slice initializer and `resetViewerState`, so the two paths can't
    drift.
  - Replaced `as any` cast around `AbortSignal.any` with a typed
    intersection.
  - Doc comment on `pointCloudSizeMode` now matches the actual default
    (`fixed-px`).

  Verified: 61 pointcloud unit tests pass, full repo typecheck (24/24),
  test suite green (22 runs), viewer Vite build emits decode-worker
  chunk correctly.

## 1.17.0

### Minor Changes

- [#597](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/597) [`370e084`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/370e084e94e8fce930bddf948344c4b639d196f3) Thanks [@joepaddock-uk](https://github.com/joepaddock-uk)! - Add `transparencyOverrides?: Map<expressId, alpha>` to `RenderOptions` for
  per-frame alpha control (X-Ray mode).

  Non-selected meshes/batches whose `expressId` appears in the map render at the
  override alpha through the existing transparent pipeline. Selected meshes are
  exempt so highlight rendering stays opaque. Mixed batches (some entries
  overridden, some not) take the minimum override alpha — the selection
  highlight pass then re-renders selected meshes opaque on top, so the user sees
  selection in full while the rest fades.

  Use case: viewers that want a true see-through "X-Ray" effect (selection visible
  through ghosted geometry) instead of fully hiding non-selected elements via
  `isolatedIds`.

  Per-batch alpha resolution walks `batch.expressIds` per frame. For typical batch
  sizes the cost is well below noise vs. the GPU work, and callers supply a fresh
  Map when contents change (same convention as `hiddenIds`/`isolatedIds`). Routing
  is purely per-frame — no mutation of `batch.color`, so IFC-declared alpha baked
  into cached batches stays untouched.

  Also fixes a correctness bug in partial sub-batch pipeline selection: when
  X-Ray + hide/isolate combine, the pipeline now uses the resolved override alpha
  (via `alphaForBatch`) instead of the parent batch's original `color[3]`, ensuring
  transparent overrides route through the transparent pipeline with proper blending.

### Patch Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

  over the underlying material instead of replacing it. Previously the
  overlay pipeline only respected the RGB channels; alpha below 1.0 produced
  muddy opaque colour. With this change the overlay path honours per-entity
  alpha + skips the glass-fresnel branch, so the 4D animator's preparation
  ghost and palette-intensity slider render as proper translucent tints.

### Minor Changes

- [#561](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/561) [`8f4df0e`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/8f4df0e50e22419353829114b5af80cfd5d45805) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - 3D section cap with screen-space hatches, driven by exact cut polygons.

  ### `@ifc-lite/renderer`

  - **3D cut surface (cap) rendering.** `Section2DOverlayRenderer` gained
    a fill pipeline that paints the user's cap style on top of the exact
    polygons `SectionCutter` produces from triangle-plane intersection.
    Eight built-in screen-space hatch patterns are supplied via the new
    `section-cap-style.ts` module: `solid`, `diagonal`, `crossHatch`,
    `horizontal`, `vertical`, `concrete` (clean dot grid, ISO 128-50),
    `brick`, `insulation`. Pattern ids match the numeric branches in the
    fill fragment shader and are pinned by unit tests so changes can't
    drift silently. New `Section2DOverlayCapStyle` shape carries fill,
    stroke, pattern id, spacing/angle/width, and a secondary cross-hatch
    angle.
  - **Outline + fill toggle independently.** `Section2DOverlayOptions`
    has new `showFills` and `showOutlines` booleans, both honoured by
    `Section2DOverlayRenderer.draw()`, so callers can hide the cut hatch
    without losing the line drawing or vice versa.
  - **Cap respects model depth.** Both fill and outline pipelines test
    with `depthCompare: 'greater-equal'` (reverse-Z) and don't write
    depth, so when the camera looks through closer model geometry the
    cap is occluded naturally. Cap polygons live exactly on the plane,
    so equal-depth ties tie cleanly with greater-equal.
  - **Cap fill landed exactly on the plane.** Removed the old 0.3 m
    vertical bias that made the hatch visibly drift off the slider
    position; the fill now sits on the cut surface itself.
  - **Depth format unified at `depth24plus-stencil8`.** Main, instanced,
    section-plane preview, and 2D overlay pipelines all declare the same
    depth/stencil format and route through `PIPELINE_CONSTANTS.DEPTH_FORMAT`
    so the literal lives in exactly one place. All in-pass pipelines also
    declare both colour attachments (main colour + objectId, the latter
    with `writeMask: 0`) so WebGPU validation passes regardless of which
    shaders render inside the section render pass.
  - **`flipped` flag plumbed end-to-end.** Main and instanced fragment
    shaders pack `enabled` (bit 0) + `flipped` (bit 1) into one flag slot
    and negate the keep side when flipped — slider position stays where
    it is, only the kept half swaps.
  - **`SectionCapStyle`, `HatchPatternId`, `DEFAULT_CAP_STYLE`, and
    `HATCH_PATTERN_IDS` exported from the package** as the canonical
    styling primitives consumed by the viewer store and the fill shader.
  - **Renderer log on first section enable** (`[Section] Y-up bounds
used for clip: …`) so a user can verify the slider range matches
    their geometry without opening a debugger.

  ### `@ifc-lite/drawing-2d`

  - **Plane equation no longer changes when `flipped`.** Both
    `SectionCutter` and `gpu-section-cutter` now build the plane normal
    from `getAxisNormal(axis, false)` regardless of the flipped flag.
    Previously the flipped normal was paired with an unchanged
    `planeDistance`, which described a different plane (`y = -position`
    instead of `y = position`) — the cutter then looked for intersections
    far outside the model and produced an empty 2D drawing. `flipped` is
    still honoured by `projectTo2D` so the resulting drawing mirrors
    correctly when viewed from the opposite side.

  ### `viewer`

  - **`SectionCapControls` panel.** New compact controls inside the
    expanded Section panel: independent Display toggles for _Surfaces_
    (cap fill) and _Lines_ (outline), hatch pattern dropdown, fill +
    stroke colour pickers, and Spacing / Angle / Width number inputs in
    a 3-col grid. The hatch fieldset disables itself when Surfaces are
    off so users can't tweak settings that don't apply. Every control
    has an explicit `id`/`htmlFor` association via `useId()` for
    assistive tech.
  - **Flip button reflects state.** Now toggles `variant` to `default`,
    carries `aria-pressed`, and swaps `aria-label`/`title` between
    "Flip cut direction" and "Unflip cut direction".
  - **Auto-enable on slider/axis change.** Moving the position slider or
    picking a direction now sets `enabled: true` so users no longer get
    stuck in a no-op "preview mode" wondering why nothing cuts. The
    bottom toggle relabelled "Clip on/off" instead of the old
    "Cutting/Preview" wording that read as if the cut was always live.
  - **2D panel auto-fits on Flip.** `useViewControls` now triggers
    `fitToView` on `sectionPlane.flipped` change as well as axis change,
    so flipping doesn't park the polygons off-screen and leave the
    panel blank.
  - **Cap style persists across reloads.** `showCap`, `showOutlines`,
    and the full `capStyle` (fill, stroke, pattern, spacing, angle,
    width, secondary angle) round-trip to `localStorage` under the keys
    `ifc-lite:section-cap-show`, `ifc-lite:section-outlines-show`, and
    `ifc-lite:section-cap-style`. `resetSectionPlane()` clears them so
    the default button actually resets. `resetViewerState()` (called on
    every IFC load) preserves persisted cap settings and only clears
    axis/position/enabled/flipped — so opening a new file no longer
    wipes the user's hatch and colour choices.
  - **Cap style types deduplicated.** `SectionCapHatchId` and
    `SectionCapStyle` in the viewer store are now re-exports of the
    renderer's `section-cap-style.ts`, so adding a new pattern only
    requires editing the renderer.
  - **localStorage failures are diagnosable.** Every persistence catch
    in `sectionSlice` now logs via `console.warn` instead of a bare
    `catch {}` — quota / private-mode / serialisation failures still
    fall back gracefully but show up in devtools.

### Patch Changes

  Several relative imports in the source omitted the `.js` extension. Under the old workspace `moduleResolution: "bundler"` TypeScript tolerated them and emitted the specifiers verbatim, so `dist/*.js` shipped extensionless relative imports. Bundlers (Vite/webpack/esbuild) resolved them transparently, but Node's native ESM resolver strictly requires the file extension and threw `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` — most visibly in `@ifc-lite/renderer`'s `dist/snap-detector.js` importing `./raycaster`.

  All offending relative imports have been rewritten to include explicit `.js` (or `/index.js` for directory imports), and every publishable package's TypeScript config now uses `module: "nodenext"` + `moduleResolution: "nodenext"` so the TypeScript compiler rejects extensionless relative imports at build time, preventing regressions. Every published package has been smoke-imported via `node --input-type=module` to verify the fix end-to-end.

Zoom now splits each step between distance reduction and forward travel, preventing the Zeno's paradox effect where the camera asymptotically approaches the target but never passes it. Refactor camera-controls to extract vec3/spherical helpers, eliminate duplicated orbit math, and use named constants.

At the start of every orbit drag (mouse or touch), a raycast determines what the user is looking at and uses that as the rotation center. If the cursor is over empty space, falls back to the camera target. Removes the old selection-based orbit center which was less intuitive.

Shift-to-sprint doubles movement speed. Mouse drag in walk mode does full orbit (look around) instead of partial orbit + zoom. Remove orbit and pan tools from toolbar — orbit is the default mouse behavior and pan is accessible via middle/right-click.

  **Renderer — visual enhancements:**

  - Add fullscreen post-processing pass (`PostProcessor`) with depth-based contact shading and object-ID-based separation lines for improved visual clarity between adjacent elements
  - Add configurable edge contrast enhancement via shader uniforms with adjustable intensity
  - New `VisualEnhancementOptions` API with independent quality presets (`off` / `low` / `high`), intensity, and radius for contact shading, separation lines, and edge contrast
  - Automatically disable expensive effects on mobile devices

  **Renderer — render pipeline changes:**

  - Add second render target (`rgba8unorm` object ID texture) to all render pipelines (opaque, transparent, overlay, instanced) for per-entity boundary detection
  - Expand vertex format from 6 to 7 floats (position + normal + entityId) across all pipelines and the picker
  - Encode entity IDs into the object ID texture via 24-bit RGB encoding in fragment shaders
  - Depth texture now created with `TEXTURE_BINDING` usage for post-processor sampling
  - Edge contrast rendering made conditional via uniform flags (`flags.z` / `flags.w`) instead of always-on

  **Renderer — geometry & scene:**

  - `GeometryManager` interleaves entity ID into the 7th float of each vertex buffer
  - `Scene` batching writes entity IDs per-vertex into merged buffers for instanced rendering

  **Data — entity type system expansion:**

  - Add ~30 new `IfcTypeEnum` entries: chimney, shading device, building element part, element assembly, reinforcing bar/mesh/tendon, discrete accessory, mechanical fastener, flow controller/moving device/storage device/treatment device/energy conversion device, duct/pipe/cable segments, furniture, proxy, annotation, transport element, civil element, geographic element
  - Add ~11 new type definition enums: pile type, member type, plate type, footing type, covering type, railing type, stair type, ramp type, roof type, curtain wall type, building element proxy type
  - Map `*StandardCase` variants (e.g. `IFCSLABSTANDARDCASE`, `IFCCOLUMNSTANDARDCASE`) to their base enum values for correct grouping
  - Expand `TYPE_STRING_TO_ENUM` and `TYPE_ENUM_TO_STRING` maps with all new types
  - Add new `ifc-entity-names.ts` with 888-line UPPERCASE → PascalCase lookup table (all IFC4X3 entity names) for correct display of any IFC entity type
  - Add `rawTypeName` field to `EntityTableBuilder` storing normalized type name as string index
  - `getTypeName()` now falls back to `rawTypeName` for types not in the enum, eliminating "Unknown" display for valid IFC types

  **Parser:**

  - Add diagnostic `console.debug` logging for spatial entity extraction and `console.warn` on extraction failures

  **WASM / Rust geometry engine:**

  - Replace overly broad geometry entity filter (`starts_with("IFC") && !ends_with("TYPE") && ...`) with explicit whitelist of ~120 IfcProduct subtypes in `has_geometry_by_name`, preventing non-product entities (e.g. `IfcDimensionalExponents`, `IfcSurfaceStyleRendering`) from being sent to geometry processing
  - Add `SolidModel` to the accepted representation types in the geometry router (6 match arms)
  - Use smooth per-vertex normals for extruded circular profiles (cylinder side walls) with `is_approximately_circular_profile` heuristic that detects circular vs polygonal profiles by coefficient of variation of radii from centroid
  - Increase circle tessellation from 24 to 36 segments for profiles (circle, circle hollow, trimmed curve, ellipse)
  - Increase swept disk solid tube segments from 12 to 24 for smoother pipes
  - Fix `PolygonalFaceSet` processing: generate flat-shaded meshes with per-face normals via `build_flat_shaded_mesh` and fix closed-shell winding orientation via `orient_closed_shell_outward`
  - Improve geometry extraction statistics: separate "no representation" (expected) from actual processing failures in diagnostic logging
  - Add `console.debug` logging for entities skipped due to missing representation

  **Viewer app:**

  - Add visual enhancement state to Zustand UI slice with 10 configurable properties (enabled, edge contrast enabled/intensity, contact shading quality/intensity/radius, separation lines enabled/quality/intensity/radius)
  - Wire `VisualEnhancementOptions` through `Viewport`, `useAnimationLoop`, and `useRenderUpdates` via memoized ref pattern
  - Show IFC type name instead of "Unknown" for spatial entities with generic names in the tree hierarchy
  - Expand `useThemeState` hook with all visual enhancement selectors
