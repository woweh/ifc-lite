## 1.20.0

### Minor Changes

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Per-class visibility toggles for ASPRS-classified point clouds.

  A new "Classes" section in the point cloud panel exposes a checkbox
  list of every LAS 1.4 standard class (Ground, Vegetation, Building,
  Water, Wires, Bridge deck, ...). Toggling a class hides every point
  with that classification. Works in any colour mode; the swatch
  colours mirror the splat shader's classification palette so the UI
  matches what's on screen.

  Implementation:

  - New `pointCloudClassMask: number` (u32 bitmask, default
    `0xFFFFFFFF`) on the point cloud slice. `togglePointCloudClass(id)`
    flips a single bit; `setPointCloudClassMask(mask)` replaces all 32.
  - `PointCloudRenderOptions.classMask` plumbed through the renderer.
    Stored in uniform slot `flags.w` (was unused).
  - Splat shader checks `(flags.w >> classId) & 1` per vertex; hidden
    classes get a degenerate `clipPos = vec4(0, 0, -2, 1)` so they're
    culled before rasterisation rather than wasted on a fragment-stage
    discard.
  - New `PointCloudClasses` component in the panel renders a
    `<details>` collapsible with "Show all" + per-class toggles. A
    badge surfaces "N of 32 visible" when not all are on.
  - `usePointCloudSync` forwards the mask to
    `setPointCloudOptions({ classMask })`.

  Class ids ≥32 always show — the mask only covers the standard
  range. Custom-labelled scans need a richer UI (deferred).

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - BIM ↔ scan deviation heatmap — GPU compute pipeline that colours each
  scan point by signed distance to the nearest mesh surface. Works with
  every IFC ingest path (STEP / IFCx / GLB / federated) and with every
  point cloud format (inline IFCx + streamed LAS / LAZ / PLY / PCD / E57
  / PTS / XYZ — anywhere `Scene.forEachMeshData` reaches and any node
  the splat pipeline already renders).

  Pipeline:

  1. **Per-triangle BVH** built from `Scene.forEachMeshData()` —
     reaches every CPU-side `MeshData` regardless of source. Median
     split along longest axis, max 16 tris per leaf, flattened to a
     `Float32Array` of 32-byte nodes during the build (no second
     pass).
  2. **Two GPU storage buffers** — nodes + triangles — uploaded once
     per mesh-set change. Cached by a `(meshCount, totalPositions)`
     fingerprint so re-running deviation against the same model is a
     pure dispatch.
  3. **Compute shader** with stack-based BVH descent (workgroup-size
     64). Per point: descend BVH pruning by squared point-to-AABB
     distance, run Ericson §5.1.5 closest-point-on-triangle on every
     leaf candidate, output signed distance via the closest face's
     precomputed normal.
  4. **Per-chunk deviation buffer** allocated alongside the splat
     vertex buffer (`STORAGE | VERTEX | COPY_DST`, 4 bytes per point,
     zero-initialised). Compute reads the vertex buffer's positions
     directly — no CPU copy of streamed clouds needed.
  5. **Splat shader** gains a 2nd vertex buffer (location 4 = `f32`
     deviation), a new `deviation` color mode, and a diverging
     blue → white → red `deviation_ramp`. Uniform block grows by 16
     bytes (new `deviationRange: vec4<f32>` slot for centre + half-
     range), `POINT_UNIFORM_SIZE` 208 → 224.
  6. **Public API** — `Renderer.computeDeviations({ maxRange?,
forceRebuild? })` returns `{ bvhTriangles, bvhNodes,
chunksProcessed, pointsProcessed, bounds, suggestedHalfRange }`.
     Awaits `queue.onSubmittedWorkDone` so callers see populated
     buffers when the promise resolves.
  7. **UI** — new `DeviationPanel` inside `PointCloudPanel`. Compute
     button (gated on `triangleCount > 0`), live progress + duration
     readout, range slider in millimetres (1 mm to 1 m), inline
     blue-white-red legend. Auto-suggests a half-range from the BVH
     bbox (±max-extent / 1000) and auto-switches the colour mode to
     `deviation` on success.
  8. **Slice** — `pointCloudColorMode` gains `'deviation'`, plus
     `pointCloudDeviationCenterOffset`, `pointCloudDeviationHalfRange`
     (default ±5 cm), and `pointCloudDeviationComputed`. Sync hook
     forwards the range to the renderer uniform.

  Sign convention: positive = scan point is on the outward-normal
  side of the closest triangle (typical "scan overshoots wall by
  5 mm"). Negative = inside / behind. Non-watertight BIM (typical
  IFC) means "inside the building" isn't globally defined, but
  per-surface front/back is always meaningful.

  Limitations / future work:

  - The dispatch processes every uploaded point against every
    triangle in the scene; isolated / hidden meshes still contribute
    to the BVH. A `meshFilter` predicate is a natural follow-up.
  - Histogram + auto-range from p5/p95 not yet implemented — the
    default half-range suggestion is a coarse bbox/1000 heuristic.
    Phase B will add a 2nd compute pass with atomic histogram.
  - The BVH walk uses a 64-deep per-thread stack. Pathologically
    unbalanced trees (>64 deep) silently drop the deepest branch.
    Real BIMs don't get there; SAH or surface-area cost would help
    if we ever hit it.

  Verified: full repo typecheck (24/24), 655 viewer tests, viewer
  Vite build green.

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Near-term UX features from #611.

  **Hover XYZ readback.** GPU pick now also samples the depth texel at
  the click position and unprojects it through the inverse view-
  projection. `PickResult` carries an optional `worldXYZ`. Reverse-Z is
  honoured (depth=1 = near, 0 = far / miss). The hover tooltip shows
  `x, y, z` (2 decimals) under the entity id. Useful for measurement
  hooks and point-cloud picks where the synthetic entity has no
  surface property to display.

  **Solid-color picker.** When the point-cloud panel's colour mode is
  set to `fixed`, a native `<input type="color">` swatch appears.
  Hex round-trips through the existing `[r,g,b,a]` store tuple.

  **Colour-mode legend.** A new `PointCloudLegend` component renders
  inline beneath the colour-mode buttons:

  - Classification → list of ASPRS LAS 1.4 class id / colour swatch /
    label (Ground, Vegetation, Building, ...). Palette mirrors
    `point-shader.wgsl.ts` exactly.
  - Intensity → black-to-white gradient bar with low/high labels.
  - Height → cool-warm gradient bar (blue → cyan → green → yellow →
    red), matching the shader's `height_ramp`.
    RGB and Solid don't render a legend.

  **Cancel button for in-flight streams.** New
  `activeStreamCanceller` field on the loading slice. Both ingest
  sites (`useIfcLoader`, `useIfcFederation`) register
  `() => streamHandle.cancel()` after starting and clear on success /
  error. `StatusBar` shows a Cancel button while the canceller is
  non-null. AbortError on cancel is reported as "Cancelled" rather
  than a scary error string.

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - PTS / XYZ ASCII point cloud reader.

  Both formats are line-oriented plain-text scans common in legacy
  survey workflows. They share the same syntax — they differ only in
  the optional first-line point count (PTS may have one; XYZ never
  does). One shared decoder + streaming source handles both.

  Auto-detected per-line layouts (by column count of the first data
  line):

  - 3 cols → `X Y Z`
  - 4 cols → `X Y Z I` (intensity)
  - 6 cols → `X Y Z R G B`
  - 7 cols → `X Y Z I R G B` (canonical PTS)
  - 9 cols → `X Y Z R G B Nx Ny Nz` (XYZ-with-normals; normals dropped)
  - 10 cols → `X Y Z I R G B Nx Ny Nz` (PTS-with-normals; normals dropped)
  - For XYZ with unknown column counts ≥3 we still emit positions and
    skip the rest, so weird custom exports load instead of erroring.

  Other behaviour:

  - Comment lines (`#`, `//`) and blank lines are skipped.
  - Intensity normalisation: 0..1 vs 0..255 vs raw sensor detected from
    the observed maximum, then mapped to u16.
  - RGB normalisation: same heuristic (>1.0 → 0..255 source).
  - Whole-file decode wrapped in `AsciiPointsStreamingSource`; the
    streaming host's 25M-point cap stride-downsamples on the way out.

  Wired into the decode worker, format detection
  (`detectPointCloudFormat` returns `'pts'` / `'xyz'`), the file
  picker accept lists, drop handlers, and both `useIfcLoader` /
  `useIfcFederation` ingest branches. The "PTS / XYZ ASCII points —
  not yet supported" toast is removed from `describeUnsupportedFormat`.

  10 new unit tests cover layout probing, decoder round-trips for the
  common shapes, and the comment / header-count edge cases.

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - GPU rectangle pick (marquee select) — meshes + point clouds.

  Hold `Ctrl` (or `⌘` on macOS) and drag with the left mouse button
  in the select tool to draw a rectangle. On release, every entity
  (mesh or point cloud) whose pixel falls inside the rect becomes
  the new selection. A teal-dashed SVG outline tracks the drag.

  Implementation:

  - `Picker.pickRect(x0, y0, x1, y1, …) → Set<expressId>` renders the
    same pick pass as `pick()` and reads back the texel rect, deduping
    hits to a Set. Mesh + point splats both participate (point splats
    share the depth buffer in the pick pass).
  - A new private `Picker.renderPickPass` extracts the shared render-
    pass setup so single-pixel `pick` and rect `pickRect` don't drift.
  - `PickingManager.pickRect` applies the same visibility filtering
    (`hiddenIds`, `isolatedIds`) as `pick`. The CPU-raycast and
    dynamic-mesh-creation fallbacks `pick` uses for very large batched
    models are skipped — rect pick only sees already-hydrated meshes.
  - `Renderer.pickRect` exposes the manager's API.
  - New `RectSelectionOverlay` component renders the dashed SVG box
    while dragging; lives inside `Viewport.tsx` as a sibling of the
    canvas.
  - `useMouseControls` tracks a new `mouseState.isRectSelecting` flag,
    suppresses orbit/pan during the drag, and on mouseup runs
    `renderer.pickRect(...)` and feeds the result into
    `setSelectedEntityIds`. A 4-pixel minimum rect size avoids
    clobbering selection on a stray Ctrl-click.
  - `MouseState.isRectSelecting?: boolean` and a new
    `setRectSelection?` callback added to `UseMouseControlsParams`.

  Lasso (polygonal) pick still pending — covered by issue #611's
  mid-term list. Per-class isolation for points is a separate
  follow-up.

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Section-plane drag preview — render at 1/4 density during slider
  drag for responsive section-cutting on huge point clouds.

  The splat shader gains a `previewStride` uniform that culls
  `(instance_index % stride) != 0` at the start of `vs_main`. The
  section-plane position slider wires `onPointerDown` to set
  `previewStride: 4` and `onPointerUp` to restore `1`, so scans of
  millions of points stay responsive while the user drags.

  Implementation:

  - `POINT_UNIFORM_SIZE` bumped from 208 → 224 to add a new
    `extras: vec4<u32>` slot. `extras.x` carries `previewStride`;
    `yzw` reserved for future per-frame state.
  - `PointCloudRenderOptions.previewStride?: number` clamped to
    [1, 256] in the renderer.
  - Vertex shader culls hidden instances by writing
    `clipPos = vec4(0, 0, -2, 1)` (outside reverse-Z `[0, 1]`) so they
    drop pre-rasterisation.
  - New `pointCloudPreviewStride` field on the point cloud slice
    (default 1) with `setPointCloudPreviewStride` action.
  - `usePointCloudSync` forwards the stride to
    `setPointCloudOptions`.
  - `SectionOverlay`'s position slider triggers stride 4 on
    drag start (pointer + keyboard), 1 on release. Only flips when
    `pointCloudAssetCount > 0` so IFC-only sessions are unaffected.

  Triangle meshes ignore the stride — they're cheap enough that
  section drag was already smooth.

  Verified: full repo typecheck (24/24), 655 viewer tests, viewer
  Vite build green.

### Patch Changes

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix LAZ load failing with `WebAssembly: Response has unsupported MIME
type 'text/plain'` on real-world files (e.g. autzen-classified.laz).

  `laz-perf`'s emscripten shim resolves the wasm via `locateFile()` and
  calls `fetch("laz-perf.wasm")` relative to its own script directory.
  In a Vite-bundled module worker that path becomes `/assets/<chunk>/…`
  or just `/laz-perf.wasm` — both 404, and the SPA fallback returns
  `index.html` as `text/plain`, which `instantiateStreaming` rightly
  rejects. The async fallback then 404s the same way and aborts.

  `loadLazPerf` now resolves the wasm asset URL through Vite's
  `?url` import (`laz-perf/lib/web/laz-perf.wasm?url`), pre-fetches the
  bytes itself, and hands them to emscripten as `Module.wasmBinary` so
  the shim's own fetch is bypassed entirely. Failure modes (asset
  resolution, fetch HTTP error) now produce a precise error message
  naming the URL and status instead of the opaque emscripten "Aborted".

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Near-term batch — correctness + robustness items from #611.

  **`computeBBox` empty / non-finite guards.** Both `e57.ts` and
  `ifcx-points.ts` now return `{0,0,0}/{0,0,0}` for empty arrays and
  skip non-finite triplets. Previously a zero-point or NaN-poisoned
  chunk produced ±Infinity bounds that broke camera fit-to-view and
  section-plane sliders.

  **Magic-byte-first format detection.** `detectPointCloudFormat` now
  probes the buffer (E57 magic, LASF magic, "ply" / "#" / ".PCD"
  ASCII tokens) before falling back to extension. A LAS file
  mistakenly named `*.ply` no longer goes down the wrong decoder. LAS
  vs LAZ still uses the extension to disambiguate (they share the
  LASF magic).

  **E57 packet-bounds + per-stream guards.** Validate that the
  DataPacket header, bytestream-length table, and each individual
  bytestream stay inside `payloadEnd = packetEnd - 4` before reading.
  Corrupt files now fail with a precise "bytestream X runs past
  packet payload" error instead of silently reading into the next
  packet.

  **`e57.ts` split (631 → 4 files).** `e57-page.ts` (header / page CRC
  / section-header resolver), `e57-xml.ts` (prototype + Data3D
  parser), `e57-decode.ts` (per-scan binary decoder), `e57.ts`
  (orchestrator + re-exports). All four under the AGENTS ~400-line
  guideline.

  **`point-cloud-renderer.ts` extract.** Pulled the uniform-block
  writer into `point-cloud-uniforms.ts` (`writePointCloudUniforms` +
  mode index maps). Renderer drops below 400 lines.

  Verified: 62 pointcloud unit tests pass, full repo typecheck
  (24/24).

- [#614](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/614) [`7efc878`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/7efc8783314559b674509131f1e203ae7c1fda8e) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Round 2 of CodeRabbit feedback on PR #614:

  - **E57 stride downsampling drops classifications.** `applyStride` rebuilt
    positions / colors / intensities into new arrays but never copied the
    per-point class IDs, so any non-default stride (`{ stride: 2 }` and up)
    silently lost them and `hasClassification` flipped to false.
  - **Federation abort can stomp a newer load.** The AbortError handler in
    `useIfcFederation.addModel()` wrote `progress`, `error`, and `loading`
    unconditionally — if a second `addModel()` started after the first was
    cancelled, it lost its spinner and progress to the cancelled load's
    cleanup. Added a `loadSessionRef` token (mirrors `useIfcLoader`) and
    gate state writes on `loadSessionRef.current === currentSession`.
  - **E57 Integer classification subtracts `minimum`.** Class IDs are
    absolute labels (ASPRS LAS 1.4 0..31), not range-normalised offsets.
    `raw - minimum` was corrupting class IDs whenever a producer declared
    a non-zero `minimum` on the Integer-encoded classification field. The
    Integer branch now matches the ScaledInteger branch's intent: keep
    the raw byte, clamp to 0..255.
  - **PCD probe missed `VERSION` / `FIELDS` headers.** The magic-byte
    detector only recognised `# .PCD …` comment-style headers. Real PCDs
    emitted by PCL's `pcl_io` and a few third-party tools start directly
    with `VERSION 0.7\n…` or `FIELDS x y z\n…` — these now route through
    the PCD decoder instead of falling through to extension-based
    detection (which would mis-route a renamed PCD).
  - **Catch-block logging.** Per repo convention, log point-cloud ingest
    failures in `useIfcLoader.ts` before the early return so abort vs.
    real-failure vs. stale-session paths are distinguishable in console
    triage.

  Test cleanup: drop the shadowed (and unused) ScaledInteger packet
  buffer in `e57.test.ts` so only the live `fullBuf` setup remains.

## 1.19.2

### Patch Changes

- [#622](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/622) [`28db7df`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/28db7df0fa64dc8cab0d08f4948fb1d9b67e0f70) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Cesium overlay: precomputed terrain placement, ground-floor clamping,
  and a refactored camera path.

  **Placement is now resolved before the bridge is built** (no more
  "model loads at IFC OrthogonalHeight, then jumps to terrain"):

  - `terrain-elevation.ts` (new module) tries sources in fast-first
    order — sync `globe.getHeight`, sync `scene.sampleHeight`, async
    `scene.sampleHeightMostDetailed` with a 3.5 s timeout, then
    Open-Meteo as a bare-earth fallback. Implausible elevations
    (e.g. depth-buffer noise from Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles
    returning `-69184 m`) are range-checked against terrestrial bounds.
    Results are cached per-session via `clearTerrainElevationCache()`.
  - `sampleHeightMostDetailed` runs _before_ Open-Meteo so the model
    lands on the same surface the user actually sees in 3D Tiles
    (street decks, podiums) rather than the bare-earth DEM.
  - `createCesiumBridge` accepts a `placementHeightOverride` so the
    computed placement is baked into the `enuToEcef` origin altitude
    for both camera frame and model matrix from creation.

  **`findClampAnchorY` (new helper, 9 unit tests)** picks the anchor
  viewer-Y that auto-clamp pins to terrain. Primary: the
  `IfcBuildingStorey` whose elevation is closest to 0 (ground floor),
  within the model AABB. Fallback: `bounds.min.y`. Without this,
  basements and foundations dragged the model deep below the terrain
  surface.

  **`oHeightForBaseAltitude`** in the Georeferencing panel now mirrors
  the auto-clamp formula (anchor-aware, shift- and RTC-aware), so the
  "Set OrthogonalHeight to Cesium terrain elevation" button produces
  the same world position as toggling the clamp.

  **UX behaviours**

  - `cesiumTerrainClamp` defaults to `true` (slice + reset path).
  - Clamp toggle is now actually uncheckable — dropped the auto-toggle
    branch that fought the user's setting.
  - Editing OrthogonalHeight directly auto-releases the clamp so the
    edit takes effect (with clamp on, placement is intentionally
    terrain-anchored regardless of OrthogonalHeight).
  - Stale `terrainHeight` / `terrainClipY` are cleared when a re-query
    fails so the clip plane doesn't drift relative to the new bridge.
  - Effect 2d depends on `bridgeVersion` so the model matrix refreshes
    after an async bridge rebuild.

  **Camera navigation refactor.** Reported symptom: orbit/zoom
  restricted to the terrain plane. Two coupled root causes:

  1. `screenSpaceCameraController.enableInputs` was still default-true.
     Any input slipping past the overlay's `pointer-events: none`
     reached Cesium and got processed in the locked frame, fighting
     our externally-driven pose. Now flipped to `false` (master kill-
     switch) on top of the per-mode flags.
  2. `syncCamera` used `lookAtTransform(viewerToEcef)` to write
     position/direction/up in viewer-space. `lookAtTransform` _locks_
     Cesium's reference frame; rotate/tilt/zoom operations are then
     constrained to that local frame — the "stuck to terrain plane"
     behaviour. Refactored to clear `lookAtTransform` with
     `Matrix4.IDENTITY` and write position/direction/up directly in
     ECEF (Cesium's RTC handles shader precision for primitives).

  **Network hygiene.** `queryTerrainElevation` (Open-Meteo) gets a 5 s
  `AbortController` timeout and a `console.warn` so failures are
  visible instead of silently swallowed.

  Scale converts local engineering coordinates (in the project length unit)
  to map CRS units (e.g. `0.001` for a millimetre project with a metre map).
  ifc-lite's geometry pipeline already converts vertices to metres during
  extraction, so applying the raw Scale to viewer-space coordinates double-
  scaled the model — making the Cesium 3D world context unusable for files
  authored per spec.

  Introduces `getEffectiveHorizontalScale(scale, mapUnitScale, lengthUnitScale)`
  which returns `(scale × mapUnitScale) / lengthUnitScale` — the correct
  multiplier for metre-converted geometry. For files where Scale is set
  consistently with the unit difference this evaluates to 1.0 and the
  geometry passes through unchanged. Wired through:

  - `cesium-bridge.ts` — 3D model origin and the viewer→ENU rotation.
  - `CesiumOverlay.tsx::buildModelMatrix` — GLB placement.
  - `reproject.ts` — 2D map centre, footprint, and reverse-pick.
  - `useIfcFederation.ts` — multi-model alignment transform.

  Adds a visible amber warning in the Georeferencing panel when
  `Scale × mapUnitScale ≠ lengthUnitScale` (the IFC schema invariant) so
  authoring errors are discoverable. The warning surfaces both inline (in
  the expanded Coordinate Operation section) and as a small indicator on
  the collapsed section header.

### Minor Changes

  **E57 (ASTM E2807-11) reader.**

  - 48-byte FileHeader parser (`ASTM-E57` magic + xmlPhysicalOffset/Length
    - pageSize).
  - Page-CRC stripping: every 1024-byte physical page ends with 4 bytes
    of CRC32-C; we strip them to get the logical view that XML offsets
    reference. CRCs aren't validated (faster + still correct on
    well-formed files).
  - XML parser via `DOMParser` walks `e57Root → data3D → vectorChild` and
    extracts each scan's record count, binary fileOffset, and prototype
    fields.
  - Binary section decoder walks DataPackets, reads bytestream length
    table, decodes uncompressed Float32 / Float64 cartesianX/Y/Z plus
    optional Float colors and Integer u8 colorRed/Green/Blue.
  - ScaledIntegerNode encoding throws a clear error so the host can guide
    the user to a Float-encoded export.

  **Drop UX.** Dropping a file we can't load (Recap `.rwp/.rwi/.rwcx/.dmt`,
  `.skp`, `.zip`, Faro `.fls`, ASCII `.pts/.xyz`) now shows an
  explanatory toast describing what the format is and what to do
  (typically: "export to E57 / LAS / PLY"). Previously the drop was
  silently rejected.

  **File picker** accepts `.e57` in browser drop, the native dialog, and
  the recent-files command palette.

  7 new pointcloud unit tests cover the FileHeader parser, page-CRC
  stripping (full pages and partial trailing page), the binary packet
  walker on a hand-built single-packet scan with Float64 cartesianX/Y/Z

  - uint8 RGB, and the ScaledInteger error path.

  Tests: 48 pointcloud unit tests pass, full repo typecheck (24/24),
  test suite green (22 runs), viewer Vite build emits decode-worker
  chunk correctly.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix LAZ loading + add PLY / PCD as standalone formats; sliders feel
  responsive on first contact.

  **LAZ silently failed to load.** `laz-perf` is shipped as CommonJS,
  which Vite/webpack wrap under `.default` differently across builds.
  The previous probe only checked `lazPerf.createLazPerf` and
  `lazPerf.default` (as a function), so all real-world LAZ loads threw
  "could not find createLazPerf factory". The probe now walks four
  candidate shapes (named export, `default.createLazPerf`, `default` as
  function, namespace-as-function) and reports the visible keys when
  none match.

  **PLY + PCD now load directly.** Two new streaming sources backed by
  the existing format decoders:

  - `PlyStreamingSource` — ASCII + binary little/big-endian, optional
    RGB (uchar) + intensity. Header probe (64 KB) + whole-file decode.
  - `PcdStreamingSource` — wraps `decodePcd` (already supported PCD
    ASCII / binary / binary_compressed via inline LZF).

  Both use stride downsampling for the host's 25M-point cap.

  **Format detection** sniffs `.ply` (magic "ply"), `.pcd` (`# .P` or
  `.PCD` token), and the existing `.las/.laz` paths.

  **File picker** accepts `.ply` and `.pcd` in browser drop, the native
  dialog, and the recent-files command palette.

  **Slider UX.** Default size mode is now `fixed-px` (was `attenuated`).
  The previous default felt inert because the slider in `attenuated` mode
  is the upper _cap_ on adaptive sizing — at typical wide views the
  projected world-radius sat well below the cap, so dragging the slider
  1↔20 px never engaged. `fixed-px` always uses the slider value, and
  "Auto" is one click away when users want adaptive behaviour.

  **Worker URL fix.** `worker-client.ts` now imports
  `./decode-worker.ts` (matching geometry's pattern) so Vite's worker
  plugin resolves through the source-alias path. The package's build
  script post-rewrites that to `.js` for dist consumers.

  Tests: 41 pointcloud unit tests pass (7 new for PLY ascii/binary +
  header probe + truncation), full repo typecheck (24/24), full test
  suite (22 runs green), viewer Vite build emits the decode-worker
  chunk correctly.

  - **LAS streaming** (`.las` files) — header parser + per-point record decoder
    for ASPRS Point Data Formats 0–10, with auto-detection of "8-bit RGB
    in u16 channels" producers and on-the-fly rescaling.
  - **LAZ streaming** (`.laz` files) — wraps `laz-perf` (Apache-2.0) as a
    runtime dep, decoded inside a Web Worker so the main thread stays
    responsive.
  - **Streaming pipeline** — Blob-backed byte source, decode worker with a
    postMessage protocol that ships chunks back as transferable typed-array
    buffers, host-side controller that paces decode, applies a 25M-point
    memory cap with stride downsampling, and reports progress / completion.
  - **Renderer streaming API** — `Renderer.beginPointCloudStream`,
    `appendPointCloudChunk`, `endPointCloudStream`, `removePointCloudAsset`,
    `setPointCloudOptions`. Streamed assets coexist with IFCx-derived
    assets in separate ownership buckets so `setPointClouds` doesn't clobber
    active streams.
  - **Color modes** — `rgb` / `classification` (ASPRS palette) / `intensity` /
    `height` (cool-warm ramp) / `fixed`. Per-point classification + intensity
    travel through the GPU vertex layout and the WGSL shader picks the
    channel based on the active mode uniform.
  - **Viewer integration** — file picker accepts `.las,.laz` (browser drop +
    native dialog), a small bottom-left panel exposes the color modes when
    point clouds are loaded, and the federation registry's `modelIndex`
    flows through streaming ingest for multi-model picking parity.

  GPU-based point picking is deferred to a follow-up; clicks on points
  return null and don't crash existing mesh selection.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Point cloud rendering quality: splat pipeline + Eye-Dome Lighting.

  The 1-pixel `point-list` rendering looked great from far away but turned
  into a halftone screen as you zoomed in — `point-list` topology has no
  `gl_PointSize` equivalent in WebGPU, so density was fixed in screen space.

  This swaps the pipeline for instanced 6-vertex quad splats and adds a
  post-pass EDL for depth perception.

  **Splat pipeline**

  - `topology: 'triangle-list'`, vertex buffer `stepMode: 'instance'`,
    6 verts emitted per source point. Vertex shader picks a corner from
    `vertex_index` and inflates clip-space position by the active size.
  - Three size modes:
    - `fixed-px` — every splat is N pixels (1..20)
    - `adaptive-world` — splat covers a world-space radius, projected each
      frame; closer = bigger
    - `attenuated` (default) — adaptive but clamped to [1, N] px so splats
      stay visible at far plane and don't blow up to half the screen up close
  - Round shape: fragment discards corners outside the unit disc, so splats
    render as discs not squares.

  **Eye-Dome Lighting**

  - New `EdlPass` runs after the existing PostProcessor. Samples 4 (low) or
    8 (high) neighbouring depths at radius R px, computes mean log-depth-
    diff, darkens by `1 - exp(-300 * meanLog * strength)`. ~9 texture taps
    per pixel. Only active when point clouds are loaded.
  - Reverse-Z aware (`max(0, log(centre) - log(neighbour))`), early-out at
    the far plane.

  **UI**

  - `PointCloudPanel` gains size-mode buttons, a 1–20 px slider, a 1–100 mm
    world-radius slider (visible in adaptive/attenuated modes), and an EDL
    toggle with a 0–3 strength slider.
  - New `pointCloudSlice` fields: `pointCloudSizeMode`, `pointCloudPointSize`,
    `pointCloudWorldRadius`, `pointCloudRoundShape`, `pointCloudEdlEnabled`,
    `pointCloudEdlStrength`. Slice clamps numeric ranges.

  Renderer API additions: `setEdlOptions({enabled, strength, radiusPx,
highQuality})`. `setPointCloudOptions` now also accepts `sizeMode`,
  `worldRadius`, `roundShape`.

### Patch Changes

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Three Codex review fixes on the streaming ingest path.

  **Streamed point cloud assets leaked across model removal.** The
  renderer handle returned from `beginPointCloudStream` was discarded,
  and streamed nodes are intentionally outside the IFCx
  `setPointClouds` bucket, so removing a model left the GPU buffers
  allocated for the rest of the session. `FederatedModel` now carries
  an optional `pointCloudHandleId`; both ingest sites populate it; a
  new `usePointCloudLifecycle` hook diffs the model map on every
  change and frees handles for models that disappear.

  **Double cleanup on ingest failure.** The outer `try/catch` in both
  ingest sites called `removePointCloudAsset` + `incCount(-1)`, but
  `ingestPointCloud`'s `onError` already does the same before
  rethrowing. The duplicate cleanup pushed the asset counter negative
  and caused a "remove twice" warning. The outer `catch` now only
  handles store / UI state.

  **PCD header probe.** The streaming source used the file's reported
  size as the upper bound for the header probe; on truncated files
  that walked off the end with a confusing error. Capped the probe at
  4 KiB so malformed PCD headers fail with a clear "header > 4 KiB"
  message.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix two regressions that prevented point clouds from rendering in the viewer:

  1. **IFCx samples extracted zero points.** The entity extractor required
     `bsi::ifc::class` on every node before assigning an `expressId`, but the
     buildingSMART Point*Cloud*\*.ifcx fixtures place `pcd::base64` /
     `points::array` / `points::base64` on nodes that carry only USD
     `xformop`. Those nodes now also become first-class entities (synthetic
     `IfcGeographicElement` type) so the point cloud extractor can emit
     them. Added regression assertions in `verify-dist-hello-wall.mjs`.

  2. **`.las` / `.laz` files were silently ignored on single-file load.**
     The drop / picker single-file path goes through `useIfcLoader.loadFile`,
     which only branched on `ifcx` / `glb` / `ifc`. Added the LAS/LAZ branch
     there and wired it into the streaming ingest. Camera fit-to-view now
     triggers from `usePointCloudSync` for points-only scenes (the geometry
     streaming hook bails out early when there are no meshes).

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix `TypeError: entities.getTypeName is not a function` when picking a
  point on a streamed point cloud (LAS / LAZ / PLY / PCD / E57).

  The synthetic `IfcDataStore` that `pointCloudIngest.ts` builds for
  point-cloud-only models stubbed `entities` with only a handful of
  methods (`getId`, `getType`, `getName`, `getGlobalId`) and used method
  names that don't match the real `EntityTable` interface. Picking
  selects the synthetic expressId, which routes through the regular
  property / hover / properties-panel pipeline — that pipeline calls
  `entities.getTypeName`, `entities.getTypeEnum`,
  `properties.getForEntity`, etc., and crashed on the missing
  `getTypeName`.

  `emptyDataStore()` now produces a stub that matches the real shape:

  - `entities`: `count=1`, `expressId=Uint32Array([id])`, `typeEnum`,
    plus `getTypeName` → `'IfcGeographicElement'`, `getName` → file
    name, `getGlobalId` → `pointcloud-<id>`, and `getTypeEnum`,
    `getByType`, `hasGeometry`, `getExpressIdByGlobalId`,
    `getGlobalIdMap` covered.
  - `properties`: real `PropertyTable` shape — `entityIndex`,
    `psetIndex`, `propIndex`, `getForEntity`, `getPropertyValue`,
    `findByProperty` (all empty / no-op).
  - `quantities` / `relationships`: matching empty stubs.
  - `entityIndex.byType` includes `IFCGEOGRAPHICELEMENT → [id]` so type
    filters resolve.

  `emptyDataStore` now takes the synthetic `expressId` and `fileName` so
  the stub round-trips real data instead of `undefined`.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Round 3 of point cloud fixes — correctness gaps that block multi-model
  sessions and silent rendering stalls.

  **Federation relabel for streamed point clouds.**
  `ingestPointCloud` now emits a synthetic entry on
  `geometryResult.pointClouds`. Without this, `useIfcFederation`'s
  `idOffset` fold + `relabelPointCloudAsset` call never fired for
  LAS/LAZ/PLY/PCD/E57 streams, so picked `expressId`s for streamed
  assets collided across federated models.

  **Sync-throw cleanup.** Wrap `streamPointCloud()` in `try/catch`
  inside `ingestPointCloud`. The renderer asset and asset-count
  increment happen before the worker spins up, so a sync throw during
  validation/worker setup used to leak both. We now `removePointCloudAsset`

  - `onCountChange(-1)` before re-throwing.

  **`setPointClouds()` shrinks bounds correctly.** The replace path
  called `expandModelBoundsForPointClouds` (grow-only). Reloading IFCx
  with a smaller scan kept stale extents until `clear`. Switched to
  `recomputeModelBounds()` so bounds re-baseline from current state.

  **`requestRender()` after every mutation.** `appendPointCloudChunk`,
  `setPointCloudOptions`, `setEdlOptions`, `setPointClouds`,
  `addPointClouds`, `clearPointClouds`, `removePointCloudAsset`,
  `endPointCloudStream` now schedule a frame. Previously streamed
  chunks could sit invisible until an unrelated camera move triggered
  the next render.

  **Worker cancel race.** `worker-client.next()` now re-checks
  `signal.aborted` after `await session.send()`. A chunk that won the
  race against `cancel()` would otherwise still call `onChunk` after
  the host returned to the caller.

  **Multi-scan E57 rejection.** `parseE57Xml` now records `hasPose` per
  Data3D entry. `decodeE57` rejects multi-scan files where any entry
  carries a `<pose>` element, with a clear "registered multi-scan;
  re-export as merged" error. Previously such files silently
  concatenated in scan-local space and rendered misaligned.

  Verified: 62 pointcloud unit tests (1 new for pose flag), full repo
  typecheck (24/24), viewer Vite build green.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Address CodeRabbit + Codex review feedback on PR #608.

  Critical visual / correctness fixes:

  - Point splats rendered ~2× too large because the shader treated the
    user-facing `pointSizePx` (diameter) as the splat radius. Fixed in
    both the live splat shader and the picker shader so click targets
    match the rendered disc.
  - Routed every detected point-cloud format (`ply`, `pcd`, `e57`) through
    the streaming ingest in both `useIfcLoader` (single-file drop) and
    `useIfcFederation` (multi-file). Previously only `las/laz` got the
    pointcloud branch; `ply/pcd/e57` fell through into the IFC STEP path.
  - Federation: applied `idOffset` to `geometryResult.pointClouds` too so
    multi-pointcloud-model loads don't collide on local `expressId`.
  - `expressId` defaulted to `1` on every ingest, so multiple inline LAS
    loads collided. Now uses a process-local synthetic counter.
  - E57 integer color channels are commonly u16 (0..65535); reader was
    forcing u8 reads, distorting RGB. Now picks element width from the
    declared min/max range.
  - PCD `applyStride` preserved positions + colors but dropped intensity
    and classification, so those color modes silently broke on files
    past the 25M-point downsample cap.
  - Inline `uploadAssetToGpu` forwards `intensities` + `classifications`
    (added to `PointCloudAsset.chunk` shape).
  - Model bounds recomputed after `removePointCloudAsset` /
    `clearPointClouds` — previously stayed oversized, breaking
    fit-to-view and section sliders.
  - `usePointCloudLifecycle` disposes a model's GPU asset when the model
    stays in the store but its `pointCloudHandleId` changes (re-stream of
    the same file used to leak the old handle).
  - `resetViewerState` now clears the point-cloud slice runtime fields so
    loading a new file doesn't inherit the previous file's color mode /
    size / EDL state.

  Correctness / robustness:

  - `streamPointCloud`'s host now closes the source on probe + onOpen
    failures (single try/finally wrapping the whole open-and-decode
    flow), so worker-backed sources don't leak the decoder on parse
    errors or aborts.
  - `worker-client.close()` clears cached `info`; subsequent `open()`
    actually re-opens instead of returning stale info next to a null
    `sourceId`.
  - `LasStreamingSource.open()` and `LazStreamingSource.open()` are
    atomic on failure: state is committed only after every step
    succeeds, so a retry rerruns the probe + RGB-scale detection
    cleanly. LAZ also frees malloc'd wasm pointers in the catch path.
  - PLY decoder rejects files where `vertex` isn't the first element
    (decoder reads from `header.bodyOffset`; non-leading vertex would
    silently produce garbage).
  - `decodePointsArray` validates each `colors[i]` is a `[r,g,b]` triple
    before indexing, so malformed schemas fail with a clear message.
  - `useIfcLoader` LAS/LAZ/PLY/PCD/E57 branch is guarded by
    `loadSessionRef` on both error and success paths so a newer load can
    replace an in-flight one without overwriting the newer model state;
    stale renderer handle is freed.

  Critical webhook fixes:

  - `ViewportOverlays.tsx` had three imports between executable code;
    hoisted them above the `const isDesktop = isTauri()` declaration.
  - `edl-pass.ts` used `0u` for `texture_depth_multisampled_2d`'s
    `sample_index`; WGSL spec requires `i32`.
  - `pcd.test.ts` switched from `__dirname` to
    `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` so it works outside vitest's
    CommonJS-compat shim.

  UX polish:

  - `PointCloudPanel` toggle buttons expose `aria-pressed` so screen
    readers announce the active option.
  - `pointCloudSlice` setters reject `NaN`/`Infinity` (Math.min/max
    passes them through unchanged).
  - `BlobByteSource.read` clamps a negative `start` to `0`.
  - File-dialog filters split GLB out of the IFC bucket into a "Mesh
    Files" group.

  The flattenMatrix transpose flagged in the review is actually correct
  for USD's row-major-with-translation-in-row-3 convention (verified by
  inspecting the Point_Cloud_S1 sample's transform; the rendered scan is
  at the right world position). Added a clarifying comment so future
  reviewers don't reach for the wrong fix.

- [#608](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/608) [`0b8c860`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0b8c860d3e13c8b498c515854db74e0850ce59f1) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Round 2 of CodeRabbit review fixes — correctness + robustness.

  P1 (real correctness):

  - Federation: streamed point clouds now get the post-`idOffset` global
    expressId in picking output. New `Renderer.relabelPointCloudAsset()`
    updates a per-asset uniform (`flags.x`) the shader prefers over the
    per-vertex attribute, so federation is just a metadata write — no
    GPU buffer rewrite. `useIfcFederation.addModel` calls it after the
    pointClouds offset is applied.
  - Section-plane range now folds in `pointCloudRenderer.getBounds()`, so
    pure point-cloud scenes don't fall through to `[-100, 100]` and mixed
    scenes don't clip points outside a smaller mesh-only range.
  - `recomputeModelBounds()` now recomputes from scratch (mesh baseline +
    current pc bounds) instead of growing-only. Previously, removing one
    of several point clouds left stale oversized extents until every
    point cloud was gone.
  - `streamPointCloud` validates `chunkSize > 0` upfront; `LasStreamingSource`
    and `LazStreamingSource` reject `maxPoints <= 0`. Prevents
    zero-progress decode loops from accidental misuse.
  - E57 merge uses `some()` instead of `every()`; mixed-attribute files
    no longer drop colour/intensity for the whole merged cloud just
    because one scan lacks the channel.
  - E57 intensity is now allocated for `Integer`-encoded prototypes too
    (was silently dropped); `ScaledInteger` throws a clear error.

  P2 (robustness):

  - `xml-mini` rejects truncated input — unclosed elements throw instead
    of silently returning a partial tree.
  - `worker-client.next()` now sends a `kind: 'abort'` to the worker when
    the signal fires mid-flight. Previously cancel returned to the caller
    while the worker kept decoding.
  - `decodePointsArray` rejects empty arrays (was producing ±Infinity
    bbox); `decodePointsBase64` rejects empty strings (no silent
    downgrade to uncoloured cloud).
  - `transformPositionsZUpToYUp` guards against zero / non-finite
    homogeneous `w` (malformed `usd::xformop` matrices).

  P3 (polish):

  - `POINT_CLOUD_DEFAULTS` is now an exported constant shared by the
    slice initializer and `resetViewerState`, so the two paths can't
    drift.
  - Replaced `as any` cast around `AbortSignal.any` with a typed
    intersection.
  - Doc comment on `pointCloudSizeMode` now matches the actual default
    (`fixed-px`).

  Verified: 61 pointcloud unit tests pass, full repo typecheck (24/24),

  the renderer's Y-up convention, matching the IFCx ingest path.

  Without this, scans rendered rotated 90° onto their side because the
  renderer is Y-up internally and LIDAR / surveying formats store data
  Z-up by convention. The IFCx path applied the swap inside
  `pointcloud-extractor.ts`; the streaming path went straight from the
  worker's decoded chunk into `appendPointCloudChunk`, skipping the
  swap.

  `ingestPointCloud` now wraps `onChunk` to re-orient positions and
  bbox before forwarding to the renderer:
  Z-up: X=right, Y=forward, Z=up
  Y-up: X=right, Y=up, Z=back (negate Y to keep right-hand rule)

  Mirrors the geometry / pointcloud extractors' existing handling.

### Minor Changes

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add Element tool — instant 3D appearance, off-surface placement, 3D ghost preview.

  Three UX-blocker fixes that turn the Add Element tool into a real
  authoring surface (previously every drop emitted STEP into the overlay
  but the user saw nothing in the 3D scene until export+reparse).

  - **Instant 3D appearance.** Every `add*` action now also builds a
    renderer-frame mesh for the new element and injects it via the
    same `appendGeometryBatch` action `duplicateEntity` uses. Walls,
    beams, and members are oriented thickness-extruded boxes;
    columns, doors, and windows are axis-aligned boxes;
    slabs / roofs / plates / spaces are polygon extrusions (with fan
    triangulation good enough for typical room shapes). Storey
    elevation is read from the spatial hierarchy so multi-storey
    placements drop on the right floor. The new mesh is tagged with
    the federation-aware globalId so picking + selection work
    immediately and the property panel opens on the new entity.
  - **Off-surface placement.** A new
    `raycastStoreyFloor()` helper unprojects the cursor to a ray and
    intersects the storey floor plane (renderer Y =
    `storeyElevation`). The hover preview and click handler both
    fall back to it when the scene raycast misses, so columns can
    drop onto empty floor outside the existing geometry. Snap-to-
    surface still wins whenever there is a mesh under the cursor.
  - **3D ghost preview.** The SVG overlay now projects the about-to-
    commit element's 8 corners (or polygon ring) to screen and
    renders the silhouette via a convex-hull outline. Single-click
    types (column / door / window) show the ghost on hover before
    any clicks; two-click types (wall / beam / member) show it once
    the start point is placed. The ghost reads live per-type form
    params, so adjusting Width / Height / Thickness updates it in
    real time.

  Also includes a panel polish: when the active type is `space` an
  **Auto Spaces** section appears with snap tolerance, min area,
  height, naming pattern, and IfcSpaceTypeEnum settings + Preview /
  Generate buttons that drive the wall-graph face finder.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Annotate-in-3D — drop pins on the scene with notes.

  Press `P` (or pick the new `MapPin` button on the main toolbar),
  click anywhere in the 3D scene, type a note. A pin lands at the
  world point you clicked on, persists to localStorage, and re-anchors
  itself as you orbit / pan. Pins are 14px amber dots with a
  1-character glyph (numbered ≤ 9, dot beyond), drop shadow, idle-pulse
  on first paint (respects `prefers-reduced-motion`), emerald selection
  ring matching the existing constructive accent.

  Flow:

  - `P` toggles the Annotate tool. Toolbar gains a `MapPin` button
    with an amber active-tone, distinct from the primary blue used
    for Select / Walk / Measure / Section.
  - Cursor switches to crosshair while annotating.
  - Click → raycast into the scene → on hit, an inline note input
    drops at the click site with a guiding "What's worth noting?"
    label and the entity context inline (e.g. `· IfcSlab #2036`).
    Misses are silent — annotations are anchored to surface points
    by design, not floating in space.
  - `Enter` saves, `⇧Enter` newline, `Esc` cancels. Outside-click
    saves a non-empty draft and silently cancels an empty one.
  - Click an existing pin → popover with note + relative time +
    pen / trash icons. Edit mode mirrors the drop-input treatment.
  - Tool stays active across drops so you can drop several pins
    in sequence.

  Architecture:

  - New `annotationsSlice` — Map-keyed store (`begin/commit/cancel
Draft`, `update`, `remove`, `select`, `clearAll`). Notes are
    clamped at 2000 chars, soft-warned at 200. Persists to
    `ifc-lite:annotations:v1` in localStorage and survives a fresh
    slice instantiation. Covered by 9 unit tests.
  - New DOM-billboard overlay (`AnnotationLayer`) sitting on top of
    the WebGPU canvas. A single rAF loop re-projects every pin's
    world position to screen via `cameraCallbacks.projectToScreen`,
    skipping `setState` when nothing changed (so the loop is cheap
    when the camera is still). Pointer-events: none on the wrapper
    so empty space passes through to canvas controls; pins +
    popover opt back into pointer events explicitly.
  - `AnnotationPin`, `AnnotationPopover`, `AnnotationDropInput` —
    composable components, all amber-accented, edge-clamped,
    backdrop-blurred where it matters.

  Pins are NOT IFC entities — they live alongside the model as an
  authoring overlay. Future PRs will wire BCF round-trip and
  IfcAnnotation export, plus an annotations-list panel and category
  tags.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces — diagnostics, broader wall coverage, and a sweep of
  review feedback.

  **Auto Spaces detection.** The "no enclosed regions detected"
  failure mode now surfaces actionable counts — both in devtools
  and in the panel itself.

  - `extract-walls.ts` now tries the standard `Axis` representation
    (`IfcShapeRepresentation` with `RepresentationIdentifier='Axis'`,
    `IfcPolyline` items) **before** falling back to the
    `addWallToStore` rectangle-profile convention. That covers
    walls authored by Revit / ArchiCAD / IfcOpenShell — the previous
    extractor only handled walls placed via the Add Element tool.
    The placement chain is read once and the polyline endpoints are
    transformed through it, so rotated walls work.
  - Every wall that gets dropped is recorded with a typed reason
    (`no-axis-or-rect-profile`, `placement-not-resolvable`,
    `zero-length-axis`, …) — the panel summarises them as
    `"3× no-axis-or-rect-profile, 1× zero-length-axis"`.
  - `detectEnclosedAreas` exposes a
    `detectEnclosedAreasWithStats(...)` companion that returns
    per-stage counts (vertices, edges-after-split, faces total,
    outer / below-min-area drops, largest area). The intersection
    splitter's iteration cap now scales with input size
    (`max(100, segments * 10)`) so dense floor plans don't bail
    out early.
  - `generateSpacesFromWalls` always logs a `console.info`
    one-liner and threads a new `debug?: boolean` flag down to the
    extractor + detector for verbose tracing. The viewer's Auto
    Spaces panel exposes a "Verbose console logging" checkbox.
  - The Auto Spaces diagnostic block now shows the graph stats
    (`123v / 456e / 78f`), the drop counts, and per-reason wall
    skips. Two amber hints fire automatically when walls were
    extracted but no faces formed (likely snap tolerance), or
    when nothing extracted (likely an unsupported geometry shape).

  **Review-feedback sweep (PR #598).**

  - `addElementMeshes.linearBox()` and the SVG `linearBoxCorners`
    helper honour each endpoint's Y so a sloped beam previews as
    a sloped prism instead of being flattened to the start.
  - `bridge-store.requireStoreyId` rejects `0` (EXPRESS ids are
    1-based, `#0` is never valid).
  - `addWindow` / `addDoor` `tsParamTypes` include
    `UserDefinedPartitioningType` / `UserDefinedOperationType`
    so typed sandbox callers can hit the IFC4 round-trip without
    casts.
  - `AnnotationLayer.resolveEntityType` no longer falls back to
    `ifcDataStore` when the annotation's `modelId` is missing
    from a federated `models` map (would resolve the wrong
    entity in multi-model sessions). Single-model sessions keep
    the fallback.
  - `addDoorToStore` / `addWindowToStore` validate
    `OperationType` / `PartitioningType` against the IFC4 enum
    and re-route unknown values through
    `.USERDEFINED.` + `User-defined…Type` so custom labels
    round-trip cleanly.
  - `addWallToStore` defaults `PredefinedType` to `.NOTDEFINED.`
    (was `.STANDARD.`) to match the rest of the in-store
    builders.
  - `duplicateInStore` / `resolveDuplicateSource` allow
    `OwnerHistory` to be `null` (IFC4 made it optional). The
    duplicate emits a bare `$` token instead of `#null` for the
    omitted case.
  - `StoreEditor.addEntity` accepts an injected schema-aware
    normalizer (`setEntityTypeNormalizer`); `@ifc-lite/sdk`
    registers `normalizeIfcTypeName` + `isKnownType` at load
    time so direct callers — CLI scripts, sandbox bridge,
    unit tests — see registry-grade rejection of typos like
    `IfcWal`, plus canonical PascalCase on `EntityRef.type`.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Auto Spaces — generate IfcSpace volumes from a storey's walls.

  Pick the **Space** type in the Add Element panel and the new **Auto
  Spaces** section appears underneath the dimensions. Hit **Preview** to
  see every enclosed region the wall graph forms (live SVG overlay,
  labelled with area), then **Generate** to commit one IfcSpace per
  region. Settings: snap tolerance (collapse sloppy wall ends), min area
  (drop closets and slivers), height (extrusion), name pattern, and
  IfcSpaceTypeEnum.

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — three new modules, all parser-pure:

  - `auto-space-detect.ts` — planar-graph face finder. Snap →
    resolve crossings → DCEL half-edge graph → leftmost-turn cycle
    walk → drop unbounded faces → filter by min area. Handles
    multi-component layouts (two non-touching rooms find both),
    T-junctions, and snap-induced corner merges. 8 fixture tests.
  - `extract-walls.ts` — pulls every wall axis on a target storey
    from a parsed `IfcDataStore`. Walks
    IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure → IfcWall → placement chain →
    IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim. Optional overlay reader includes
    walls created via the Add Element tool without a re-parse.
  - `generate-spaces.ts` — orchestration: extract → detect → emit
    via `addSpaceToStore` polygon mode. `dryRun` runs detection only.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — `mutationSlice.generateSpacesFromWalls`
  returns the detection result. `AddElementPanel` gains the Auto Spaces
  section; `AddElementOverlay` projects detected outlines back to screen
  using the storey's elevation so the preview tracks the camera in
  real time.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add the `bim.store.*` namespace — high-level editing of an already-parsed
  `IfcDataStore` via the existing mutation overlay. Closes the merge-roundtrip
  gap from #592 (you can edit `IfcRectangleProfileDef.XDim` or drop a fresh
  `IfcColumn` into a model without round-tripping through a script + re-parse).

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`** — new `StoreEditor` facade plus four
  `MutablePropertyView` extensions: positional-attribute mutations, overlay
  entity creation/deletion (with watermark seeding), and three helpers used by
  the viewer's undo/redo (`removePositionalMutation`, `restoreFromTombstone`,
  `restoreNewEntity`).

  **`@ifc-lite/create`** — new `in-store/` module: `addColumnToStore` builds a
  12-entity IfcColumn sub-graph (placement, profile, extruded solid,
  representation, product shape, rel-contained-in-spatial-structure) anchored
  to a target `IfcBuildingStorey`. `resolveSpatialAnchor` walks the parsed
  store to find the IfcOwnerHistory, the 'Body' representation context, and
  the storey's local placement.

  **`@ifc-lite/sdk`** — new `StoreNamespace` exposed as `bim.store` on
  `BimContext`. Methods: `addEntity`, `removeEntity`, `setPositionalAttribute`,
  `addColumn`. Backed by `StoreBackendMethods` on `BimBackend`; the
  `RemoteBackend` proxy round-trips them through the transport.

  **`@ifc-lite/sandbox`** — `bim.store.*` is bridged into the QuickJS sandbox
  with full TypeScript types via `bim-globals.d.ts` and an LLM cheat sheet in
  the system prompt. Gated on a new `store: true` permission (default
  `false`, mirrors the existing `mutate` permission pattern).

  **`@ifc-lite/cli`** — `HeadlessBackend.store` is now functional (was a
  no-op before). Scripts run via the CLI can edit a parsed model and export it
  with mutations applied.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`** — three new UI surfaces:

  - Raw STEP tab in `PropertiesPanel` — lists every positional STEP argument
    with an inline pen-icon editor for scalar values (numbers, refs, enums,
    null). Mutated rows show a purple dot and tinted background.
  - `EntityContextMenu` gains "Delete entity" (red, calls `removeEntity`
    with toast + undo support) and "Add column here…" (emerald, only enabled
    when the right-clicked entity is an `IfcBuildingStorey`).
  - `AddColumnDialog` modal — storey picker sorted by elevation, position
    (storey-local metres), cross-section, height, name, optional collapsible
    for Description/ObjectType/Tag. Anchor-resolution failures surface
    inline, not as thrown exceptions.

  Plus four new actions on `mutationSlice` (`setPositionalAttribute`,
  `removeEntity`, `addColumn`, dialog open/close) backed by per-model
  `StoreEditor` caches, with undo/redo wired for `UPDATE_POSITIONAL_ATTRIBUTE`,
  `CREATE_ENTITY`, and `DELETE_ENTITY`.

  **`@ifc-lite/parser`** — `package.json` `exports` re-ordered to put `types`
  before `import` so downstream consumers using TS5 `nodenext` resolution
  pick up the type declarations.

  **`@ifc-lite/geometry`** — re-exports `MetadataBootstrapEntitySummary` and
  `MetadataBootstrapSpatialNode` from the package index (used by viewer
  desktop services).

  **`@ifc-lite/renderer`** — `GPUBufferDescriptor` ambient declaration gains
  `mappedAtCreation?: boolean`. Internal change; the renderer was already
  using it at runtime to skip a Mojo IPC round-trip on Chrome/Dawn.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Duplicate-from-selection — pick any IfcRoot product, hit `⌘D` (or
  right-click → Duplicate), get a fully-functional clone. The
  duplicate is a first-class entity in the property panel, exports
  cleanly to STEP with all its property associations preserved, and
  ships in 6 directional variants sized to the source's bounding box.

  **`@ifc-lite/create`**

  - New `duplicateInStore(editor, source, options)` pure builder.
    Emits a fresh placement chain (`IfcCartesianPoint` →
    `IfcAxis2Placement3D` → `IfcLocalPlacement`) plus the duplicate
    `IfcRoot` with a new GUID and the source's `Representation`
    reference reused (geometry shared). Optional fresh
    `IfcRelContainedInSpatialStructure` anchors to the source's
    storey. Offset is configurable via `options.offset` — the slice
    sizes it to the source's bbox.
  - New `resolveDuplicateSource(store, expressId)` walks the parsed
    `IfcDataStore` for placement / parent / location / storey /
    associations.
  - New `SourceAssociation` shape captures one
    `IfcRelDefines*` / `IfcRelAssociates*` edge that references
    the source. The builder replays each one against the duplicate
    so the exported STEP carries identical psets / qsets /
    materials / classifications / documents / type binding —
    without modifying any existing rel.
  - Resolver scans the five association rel types
    (`IFCRELDEFINESBYPROPERTIES`, `IFCRELDEFINESBYTYPE`,
    `IFCRELASSOCIATESMATERIAL`, `…CLASSIFICATION`, `…DOCUMENT`)
    by direct numeric membership in `RelatedObjects`.
  - `DuplicateBuildResult.associationRelIds: number[]` exposes the
    fresh rel ids for caller introspection.
  - 7 unit tests in `duplicate.test.ts`: full graph emission,
    custom offset, no-storey path, root-placement parent, attribute
    count guard, association replay (3 rel types in one go), and
    the no-associations case.

  **`@ifc-lite/mutations`**

  - New `setEntityAlias(overlayId, sourceId | null)` /
    `getEntityAlias(id)` / `resolveBaseEntityId(id)` public surface
    on `MutablePropertyView`. Aliases redirect base property and
    quantity reads from the duplicate to its source — so the
    duplicate inherits psets/qsets without eagerly cloning them
    into the overlay.
  - Override slots stay scoped to the original (overlay) id, so
    edits on the duplicate don't bleed into the source. Verified
    by 4 new unit tests including the source-untouched path,
    chain-cap (one hop, not transitive), and the self-alias guard.

  **`@ifc-lite/viewer`**

  - New `duplicateEntity(modelId, sourceExpressId, direction?)`
    slice action. Wraps the create-package builder, sets the
    mutation-view alias, and clones the source's mesh data into
    the geometry result with the offset applied — so the duplicate
    appears in 3D the moment the action fires, not just in the
    export overlay. Per-vertex `entityIds` arrays are filled with
    the new globalId so picking and selection resolve correctly.
  - New `DuplicateDirection` type (`+X` / `-X` / `+Y` / `-Y` /
    `+Z` / `-Z`). Magnitude per axis = the source's bounding-box
    dimension on that axis, so a 3m wall steps 3m and a 0.4m
    column steps 0.4m. Falls back to a 1m step when the source
    has no mesh in geometry.
  - Right-click menu's "Duplicate" item is now a `DuplicateRow`:
    primary clickable label on the left (defaults to +X), 6 axis
    chips on the right (→ ← ↗ ↙ ↑ ↓). Tooltips spell out
    "+X (east)" through "−Z (down)".
  - `⌘D` defaults to +X. `⇧⌘D` = +Z (up), `⌥⌘D` = +Y (north) —
    modifier shortcuts for power users without forcing a mouse
    trip to the chip row. Selection moves to the new globalId so
    a Cmd+D chain ("stamp a row of columns") works without
    re-clicking.
  - **`resolveGlobalIdFromModels` two-pass overlay fallback** —
    the federation resolver previously gated each model's id range
    at parse-time `maxExpressId`, which excluded every
    overlay-allocated id from selection. The fix: a second pass
    consults each model's mutation view via `getNewEntity(localId)`
    so overlay duplicates resolve to the right model with the
    right local id. Without this, the property panel saw the
    duplicate as "UNKNOWN / Unknown / no property sets" because
    the alias couldn't take effect on a wrongly-resolved id.
  - PropertiesPanel falls back to the overlay `NewEntity` record
    for type / name / GUID / Description / ObjectType when the
    parsed `entityNode` comes up empty. The bSDD attribute list
    synthesises from the schema-defined positional names. The
    Materials / Classifications / Documents / structural
    Relationships sections all route through a new
    `lookupExpressId` (alias-resolved) so they query the source's
    parsed maps directly.

  After: a freshly-duplicated wall is genuinely first-class — name
  reads, properties show, quantities show, material layers show,
  classifications show, documents show, and a round-tripped STEP
  file carries every association.

  **Gantt panel** — a lower-panel workspace combining a task tree, a zoomable
  SVG timeline with task bars / milestones / dependency arrows / playback
  cursor, a toolbar (work-schedule filter, play / pause / loop / speed, time
  scale), and an empty state. Live Gantt ↔ 3D selection highlight (one-way,
  no isolation) and playback-driven visibility through the rendererʼs
  hidden-entity channel.

  **Schedule editing** — Inspector Task card (name, identification,
  predefined type, milestone, start / finish / duration with any-two-of-three
  reconciliation, assigned products, delete with cascade). Undo / redo
  (descriptor-based lightweight snapshots for field edits; full snapshot for
  structural edits), store-scoped transactions (drag-coalesced), add / delete /
  reorder tasks. IFC STEP export routes through a centralised schedule splice
  helper so generated / edited schedules round-trip cleanly on every export
  surface.

  **Generate from hierarchy** — a Generate Schedule dialog produces a work
  schedule + tasks from the modelʼs spatial hierarchy (Storey / Building) or
  geometry (Height-slice, with optional Class / Type / Name subgroup). Linked
  FS dependencies and ghost-preparation look-ahead are opt-in.

  **4D animation** — Synchro-style phased lifecycle (preparation ghost →
  ramp-in → active task-type colour → settling fade → complete), demolition
  inversion, customizable palette, and configurable palette intensity /
  look-ahead / hide-untasked products. Animation layers live in a priority-
  composited overlay registry (`registerOverlayLayer`), with a single
  compositor hook owning the write to the rendererʼs hidden-entity + colour-
  override channels.

  **LLM integration** — built-in "Construction schedule (4D)" script template,
  PDF / spreadsheet chat attachments, and `bim.schedule.*` read APIs reachable
  from the sandbox.

- [#598](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/598) [`25c9877`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25c9877969d2dcccb9c4e61f57b188cbf5fbbc3c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Raw STEP tab — drill into `#N` references and a tighter dev-leaning
  visual treatment.

  **Reference drill-through**

  - Each `#N` token in the Raw STEP card is now a clickable chip.
    Click → drills into the target entity and shows its positional
    arguments inline; the breadcrumb at the top of the card tracks
    the path back to the 3D-selected entity.
  - **Auto-skip wrappers** — when the click target itself has only
    a single positional arg and that arg is also a `#N`, the card
    follows the chain in one click and lands on the first
    "meaningful" entity. Capped at 16 hops to defend against
    cyclic STEP graphs. So a real-world case like
    `IfcRelDefinesByProperties → IfcPropertySet` steps cleanly,
    and pure pass-through wrappers don't waste user clicks.
  - Drill state resets when the 3D selection changes — drilling
    stays scoped to a single click. Each breadcrumb segment is
    clickable to jump back to that depth.
  - Editing a `#N` ref still works via the pen icon — clicking the
    chip itself navigates instead of entering edit mode, but the
    hover-revealed pen still flips to inline-edit so a user can
    re-type the reference target.
  - Tombstoned entities short-circuit the auto-follow so the drill
    doesn't render a deleted entity's body.

  **True STEP literals on display**

  - Tokens are read directly from the source bytes via a new
    `extractRawStepTokens` helper, so refs render as `#42`, enums
    stay `.AREA.`, and strings keep their on-disk quoted form. The
    EntityExtractor's parsed JS shape strips reference prefixes
    (it parses `#42` into the integer `42`), so the previous
    formatter had no way to recover the distinction — `OwnerHistory`
    would render as `18` instead of `#18`. Fixed.
  - Overlay overrides serialize back through `serializeStepToken`
    for parity with the unmodified base tokens.

  **Overlay-aware row display**

  - Edits to positional attributes now reflect immediately in the
    row body. Previously the card re-extracted from the source
    buffer and ignored the overlay map, so the displayed value
    snapped back to the original after Save (only the purple
    overlay-override dot updated correctly).

  **Dev-leaning tab styling**

  - Raw STEP tab restyled — replaces the "Raw" plain-text label
    with a `</>` bracket glyph, shrinks the trigger to icon-only
    width via `flex: 0 0 auto`. Frees up width so Properties /
    Quantities / bSDD keep their text visible at the default
    panel size, and signals "developer view" with a terminal-green
    accent on hover / active state.

  **Add-Column UI removed**

  - The original `AddColumnDialog` + context-menu "Add column
    here…" + EditToolbar "Column" button — premature for the
    current workflow (single hard-coded element type with no
    geometry preview). Removed cleanly:
    `AddColumnDialog.tsx` (deleted), the `addColumnDialog` slice
    state, the constructive `MenuItem` tone (only used by that
    item), and the context-menu / toolbar entry points.
  - Kept: the `addColumn` slice action and the
    `bim.store.addColumn` SDK surface — those still drive scripts
    and programmatic flows, just no UI affordance for now.

  **Tombstoned mesh actually disappears**

  - Delete entity now pairs the overlay tombstone with
    `hideEntity(globalId)` so the rendered mesh is hidden from the
    GPU buffers (and stops being pickable). Undo of `DELETE_ENTITY`
    pairs `restoreFromTombstone` with `showEntity` so the entity
    returns to the scene; redo re-hides. Symmetrical round-trip.

  chip-based **Filter** tab. Storey / IFC type / Predefined type / Name /
  Property / Quantity rules compose with AND/OR + IsSet/IsNotSet and
  run through an in-memory evaluator that scales to 4M-entity models
  via `entityIndex.byType` / `spatialHierarchy.byStorey` prefilter,
  cheap-first per-entity rule ordering, and async chunked yielding
  with cancel + progress. The DuckDB engine, SQL editor, schema
  browser, templates, error rewriter, and saved-SQL-queries module
  have been removed — Builder is the whole UI now, with a single Run
  button and CSV/JSON export. Builder dropdowns are schema-aware
  (storeys + IFC types load eagerly, pset / qto names load lazily on
  first use), the inline search-bar query promotes to a Name rule
  with one click, multi-model row clicks route to the correct model,
  and saved presets persist named `{name, combinator, rules}`
  snapshots in localStorage.

  - Inline-bar Enter now flushes the 80ms debounce by re-scanning against
    the live `searchQuery`, so committing inside the debounce window
    selects the entity matching what the input shows (not the prior
    query) and records the correct recent.
  - The 50ms `frameSelection` timer in the inline bar is tracked via a
    ref and cleared on rapid selection changes / unmount instead of
    leaking orphan callbacks.
  - Shift+Enter additive selection in the inline bar and the row-level
    additive path in the Search modal now TOGGLE via `toggleEntitySelection`,
    so the same interaction can deselect a previously-added row.
  - New `addEntitiesToSelection` batch action on the selection slice;
    the Search modal's "Select all" path uses it so a 5K-row select-all
    dispatches one Zustand `set` instead of N.
  - Tier-0 scoring now keeps the max across name/type/objectType/description
    fields (matching Tier-1's behaviour). Without this, an entity with a
    substring name hit and a type-exact hit ranked lower than it should
    on Tier-0, breaking the comparable-ordering guarantee when results
    came from a mix of Tier-0 and Tier-1 models.

### Patch Changes

- [#561](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/561) [`8f4df0e`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/8f4df0e50e22419353829114b5af80cfd5d45805) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - 3D section cap with screen-space hatches, driven by exact cut polygons.

  ### `@ifc-lite/renderer`

  - **3D cut surface (cap) rendering.** `Section2DOverlayRenderer` gained
    a fill pipeline that paints the user's cap style on top of the exact
    polygons `SectionCutter` produces from triangle-plane intersection.
    Eight built-in screen-space hatch patterns are supplied via the new
    `section-cap-style.ts` module: `solid`, `diagonal`, `crossHatch`,
    `horizontal`, `vertical`, `concrete` (clean dot grid, ISO 128-50),
    `brick`, `insulation`. Pattern ids match the numeric branches in the
    fill fragment shader and are pinned by unit tests so changes can't
    drift silently. New `Section2DOverlayCapStyle` shape carries fill,
    stroke, pattern id, spacing/angle/width, and a secondary cross-hatch
    angle.
  - **Outline + fill toggle independently.** `Section2DOverlayOptions`
    has new `showFills` and `showOutlines` booleans, both honoured by
    `Section2DOverlayRenderer.draw()`, so callers can hide the cut hatch
    without losing the line drawing or vice versa.
  - **Cap respects model depth.** Both fill and outline pipelines test
    with `depthCompare: 'greater-equal'` (reverse-Z) and don't write
    depth, so when the camera looks through closer model geometry the
    cap is occluded naturally. Cap polygons live exactly on the plane,
    so equal-depth ties tie cleanly with greater-equal.
  - **Cap fill landed exactly on the plane.** Removed the old 0.3 m
    vertical bias that made the hatch visibly drift off the slider
    position; the fill now sits on the cut surface itself.
  - **Depth format unified at `depth24plus-stencil8`.** Main, instanced,
    section-plane preview, and 2D overlay pipelines all declare the same
    depth/stencil format and route through `PIPELINE_CONSTANTS.DEPTH_FORMAT`
    so the literal lives in exactly one place. All in-pass pipelines also
    declare both colour attachments (main colour + objectId, the latter
    with `writeMask: 0`) so WebGPU validation passes regardless of which
    shaders render inside the section render pass.
  - **`flipped` flag plumbed end-to-end.** Main and instanced fragment
    shaders pack `enabled` (bit 0) + `flipped` (bit 1) into one flag slot
    and negate the keep side when flipped — slider position stays where
    it is, only the kept half swaps.
  - **`SectionCapStyle`, `HatchPatternId`, `DEFAULT_CAP_STYLE`, and
    `HATCH_PATTERN_IDS` exported from the package** as the canonical
    styling primitives consumed by the viewer store and the fill shader.
  - **Renderer log on first section enable** (`[Section] Y-up bounds
used for clip: …`) so a user can verify the slider range matches
    their geometry without opening a debugger.

  ### `@ifc-lite/drawing-2d`

  - **Plane equation no longer changes when `flipped`.** Both
    `SectionCutter` and `gpu-section-cutter` now build the plane normal
    from `getAxisNormal(axis, false)` regardless of the flipped flag.
    Previously the flipped normal was paired with an unchanged
    `planeDistance`, which described a different plane (`y = -position`
    instead of `y = position`) — the cutter then looked for intersections
    far outside the model and produced an empty 2D drawing. `flipped` is
    still honoured by `projectTo2D` so the resulting drawing mirrors
    correctly when viewed from the opposite side.

  ### `viewer`

  - **`SectionCapControls` panel.** New compact controls inside the
    expanded Section panel: independent Display toggles for _Surfaces_
    (cap fill) and _Lines_ (outline), hatch pattern dropdown, fill +
    stroke colour pickers, and Spacing / Angle / Width number inputs in
    a 3-col grid. The hatch fieldset disables itself when Surfaces are
    off so users can't tweak settings that don't apply. Every control
    has an explicit `id`/`htmlFor` association via `useId()` for
    assistive tech.
  - **Flip button reflects state.** Now toggles `variant` to `default`,
    carries `aria-pressed`, and swaps `aria-label`/`title` between
    "Flip cut direction" and "Unflip cut direction".
  - **Auto-enable on slider/axis change.** Moving the position slider or
    picking a direction now sets `enabled: true` so users no longer get
    stuck in a no-op "preview mode" wondering why nothing cuts. The
    bottom toggle relabelled "Clip on/off" instead of the old
    "Cutting/Preview" wording that read as if the cut was always live.
  - **2D panel auto-fits on Flip.** `useViewControls` now triggers
    `fitToView` on `sectionPlane.flipped` change as well as axis change,
    so flipping doesn't park the polygons off-screen and leave the
    panel blank.
  - **Cap style persists across reloads.** `showCap`, `showOutlines`,
    and the full `capStyle` (fill, stroke, pattern, spacing, angle,
    width, secondary angle) round-trip to `localStorage` under the keys
    `ifc-lite:section-cap-show`, `ifc-lite:section-outlines-show`, and
    `ifc-lite:section-cap-style`. `resetSectionPlane()` clears them so
    the default button actually resets. `resetViewerState()` (called on
    every IFC load) preserves persisted cap settings and only clears
    axis/position/enabled/flipped — so opening a new file no longer
    wipes the user's hatch and colour choices.
  - **Cap style types deduplicated.** `SectionCapHatchId` and
    `SectionCapStyle` in the viewer store are now re-exports of the
    renderer's `section-cap-style.ts`, so adding a new pattern only
    requires editing the renderer.
  - **localStorage failures are diagnosable.** Every persistence catch
    in `sectionSlice` now logs via `console.warn` instead of a bare
    `catch {}` — quota / private-mode / serialisation failures still
    fall back gracefully but show up in devtools.

### Minor Changes

- [#268](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/268) [`2562382`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/25623821fa6d7e94b094772563811fb01ce066c7) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Add IFC5 (IFCX) export with full schema conversion and USD geometry

  New `Ifc5Exporter` converts IFC data from any schema (IFC2X3/IFC4/IFC4X3) to the IFC5 IFCX JSON format:

  - Entity types converted to IFC5 naming (aligned with IFC4X3)
  - Properties mapped to IFCX attribute namespaces (`bsi::ifc::prop::`)
  - Tessellated geometry converted to USD mesh format with Z-up coordinates
  - Spatial hierarchy mapped to IFCX path-based node structure
  - Color and presentation exported as USD attributes

  The export dialog is simplified: schema selection now drives the output format automatically (IFC5 → `.ifcx`, others → `.ifc`). No separate format picker needed.

  Schema converter fixes:

  - Skipped entities become IFCPROXY placeholders instead of being dropped, preventing dangling STEP references
  - Alignment entities (IFCALIGNMENTCANT, etc.) are preserved for IFC4X3/IFC5 targets

  - Replace O(total_accumulated) `.reduce()` calls in `appendGeometryBatch` with O(batch_size) incremental totals
  - Defer data model parser to after geometry streaming completes (no main-thread CPU contention with WASM)
  - Accumulate color updates locally during streaming; apply single `updateMeshColors()` at complete

  New packages:

  - `@ifc-lite/sandbox` — sandboxed script runner that transpiles and executes user TypeScript in a Web Worker with BIM globals (`bim.query`, `bim.select`, `bim.viewer`, etc.) isolated from the host page.
  - `@ifc-lite/sdk` — BIM SDK defining the full host↔sandbox message protocol and all namespaces: `query`, `mutate`, `viewer`, `spatial`, `export`, `lens`, `bcf`, `ids`, `drawing`, `list`, `events`.

  New viewer features:

  - **Command Palette** — `Cmd/Ctrl+K` fuzzy-search launcher for viewer actions and scripts.
  - **Script Panel** — full-screen code editor (CodeMirror) with run/stop controls, output log, and CSV download.
  - **6 built-in script templates** — quantity takeoff, fire-safety check, MEP equipment schedule, envelope check, space validation, federation compare.
  - **Recent files** — persisted list of previously opened IFC files.

- [#227](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/227) [`67c0064`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/67c00640a0ca344337e5e79d80888d329df9130d) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Respect system color-scheme preference on initial load.

  The app previously hardcoded dark mode. Now:

  - An inline script in `index.html` applies the correct theme class before first paint, eliminating flash of wrong theme.
  - The Zustand UI store reads from `localStorage` first, then falls back to the browser's `prefers-color-scheme` media query.
  - Theme preference persists across reloads via `localStorage`.

  - `@ifc-lite/sdk` export namespace now resolves quantity-set dot-paths (`Qto_WallBaseQuantities.NetVolume`) in addition to property-set paths, so quantity columns are no longer empty in exports.
  - All 6 built-in script templates (quantity takeoff, fire-safety check, MEP schedule, envelope check, space validation, data-quality audit) updated to dynamically discover and include relevant property/quantity columns instead of hardcoding minimal attribute lists.

- Updated dependencies [[`67c0064`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/67c00640a0ca344337e5e79d80888d329df9130d)]:

  - Click any annotation (measure, polygon area, text box, cloud) to select it — highlighted with a dashed blue border and corner handles
  - Press Delete/Backspace to remove the selected annotation
  - Drag to reposition any selected annotation
  - Double-click text annotations to re-enter edit mode
  - Escape exits annotation tools back to Select/Pan mode and deselects
  - "Select / Pan" option added to annotation toolbar dropdown
  - Performance: ephemeral drag state uses local refs instead of store updates, stable coordinate callbacks via refs, hit-test reads from storeRef to prevent callback cascade

  - Orthographic reverse-Z projection matrix in math utilities
  - Camera projection mode toggle (perspective/orthographic) with seamless switching
  - Orthographic zoom scales view size instead of camera distance
  - Parallel ray unprojection for orthographic picking

  ### Viewer

  - **Orthographic projection**: Toggle button, unified Views dropdown, numpad `5` keyboard shortcut
  - **Automatic Floorplan**: Per-storey section cuts with top-down ortho view, dropdown in toolbar
  - **Pinboard**: Selection basket with Pin/Unpin/Show, entity isolation via serialized EntityRef Set
  - **Tree View by Type**: IFC type grouping mode alongside spatial hierarchy, localStorage persistence
  - **Lens**: Rule-based 3D colorization/filtering with built-in presets (By IFC Type, Structural Elements), full panel UI with color legend and rule evaluation engine

  - Property editor validates against IFC4 standard (ISO 16739-1:2018): walls get wall psets, doors get door psets, etc.
  - Schema-version-aware property editing: detects IFC2X3/IFC4/IFC4X3 from FILE_SCHEMA header
  - New dialogs for adding classifications (12 standard systems), materials, and quantities in edit mode
  - Quantity set definitions (Qto\_) with schema-aware dialog for standard IFC4 base quantities
  - On-demand classification extraction from IfcRelAssociatesClassification with chain walking
  - On-demand material extraction supporting all IFC material types: IfcMaterial, IfcMaterialLayerSet, IfcMaterialProfileSet, IfcMaterialConstituentSet, IfcMaterialList, and \*Usage wrappers
  - On-demand document extraction from IfcRelAssociatesDocument with DocumentReference→DocumentInformation chain
  - Type-level property merging: properties from IfcTypeObject HasPropertySets merged with instance properties
  - Structural relationship display: openings, fills, groups, and connections
  - Advanced property type parsing: IfcPropertyEnumeratedValue, BoundedValue, ListValue, TableValue, ReferenceValue
  - Georeferencing display (IfcMapConversion + IfcProjectedCRS) in model metadata panel
  - Length unit display in model metadata panel
  - Classifications, materials, documents displayed with dedicated card components
  - Type-level material/classification inheritance via IfcRelDefinesByType
  - Relationship graph fallback for server-loaded models without on-demand maps
  - Cycle detection in material resolution and classification chain walking
  - Removed `any` types from parser production code in favor of proper `PropertyValue` union type

### Patch Changes

- [#202](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/pull/202) [`e0af898`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/e0af898608c2f706dc2d82154c612c64e2de010c) Thanks [@louistrue](https://github.com/louistrue)! - Fix empty Description, ObjectType, and Tag columns in lists and show all IFC attributes in property panel

  - Lists: add on-demand attribute extraction fallback with per-provider caching for Description, ObjectType, and Tag columns that were previously always empty
  - Property panel: show ALL string/enum IFC attributes dynamically using the schema registry (Name, Description, ObjectType, Tag, PredefinedType, etc.) instead of hardcoding only Name/Description/ObjectType
  - Parser: add `extractAllEntityAttributes()` for schema-aware full attribute extraction, extend `extractEntityAttributesOnDemand()` to include Tag (IfcElement index 7)
  - Query: add `EntityNode.tag` getter and `EntityNode.allAttributes()` method for comprehensive attribute access
  - Performance: cache `getAttributeNames()` inheritance walks, hoist module-level constants
  - Fix type name casing bug where multi-word UPPERCASE STEP types (e.g., IFCWALLSTANDARDCASE) failed schema lookup

- Updated dependencies [[`0967cfe`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/0967cfe9a203141ee6fc7604153721396f027658), [`057bde9`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/057bde9e48f64c07055413c690c6bdabb6942d04), [`e0af898`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/e0af898608c2f706dc2d82154c612c64e2de010c), [`6c43c70`](https://github.com/louistrue/ifc-lite/commit/6c43c707ead13fc482ec367cb08d847b444a484a)]:
