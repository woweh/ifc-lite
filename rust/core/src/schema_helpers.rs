//! Hand-maintained schema helpers built on top of the auto-generated
//! `IfcType` enum.
//!
//! These helpers used to live appended to `generated/schema.rs` despite that
//! file's "DO NOT EDIT" header. Moving them here keeps them safe from a
//! re-run of `@ifc-lite/codegen` and lets us derive answers from the EXPRESS
//! inheritance graph instead of maintaining a leaf-level allow-list that has
//! to be amended every time a new IFC4X3 subtype shows up (see PR #585 for
//! `IfcSolarDevice`, which inherits from `IfcEnergyConversionDevice` and was
//! therefore already covered conceptually by the old whitelist's parent
//! entry, but missed in practice because the whitelist was only checked by
//! string match).
