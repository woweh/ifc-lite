//! Boolean / CSG failure diagnostics.
//!
//! Pre-T1.3, the CSG processor silently fell back to returning the un-cut host
//! mesh whenever it couldn't run an operation (cap exceeded, kernel error,
//! degenerate input, etc.). This left viewers rendering wrong geometry with no
//! signal to the user.
//!
//! This module gives every fallback a structured failure record. Callers can
//! drain failures off the `ClippingProcessor` after a sequence of operations
//! and surface them — e.g. a debug overlay that highlights products with
//! failed clips, or a CI assertion that no failures occurred on a known-good
//! fixture.
//!
//! The runtime behaviour is unchanged: failures are recorded *in addition*
//! to (not instead of) the existing fallback. Sprint 2's Manifold migration
//! and Sprint 1's regression tests both rely on these records.
